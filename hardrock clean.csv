On more than one occasion, I noticed some unsanitary events. On one occasion, the cook walked back to the grill area eating a pineapple. A few minutes later he placed a pizza in the oven. I think he forgot he didn't wash his hands. 
On another occasion, I noticed the cook tasting the pizza sauce. Then he felt the need to continue stirring the pizza sauce with the same spoon. I could tell by his body movements that the spoon went directly back into the pizza sauce. 
I have worked at a restaurant or two in my time. Upon entering the kitchen, you wash you hands. You don't cook and eat at the same time. I have ate at the hotel outside restaurant several times and the cooks are allergic to the washing of the hands. 
The gym is decent. Nothing to brag about. What the gym needs is sanitary spray or antibacterial wipes. The only thing the gym offers is a green towel and a bottle of hand sanitizer. How about you let me wipe down the equipment after that sweaty guy got off of it. A green towel does not protect me from bacteria and sickness. 
You can walk to one of the bigger malls. Central Festival. You just have to leave out the back entrance and not the main entrance. It's several floors of stores with restaurants, a bowling alley, and movies at the top. Everything you need is around the hotel. Out the back entrance, you can take a motorcycle, tuk tuk, or taxi 5 minutes to Walking Street. 
On the weekends they have events that make your stay horrible. It is nothing but loud music. So, be careful on the weekends if you want to attempt to get any sleep. Look at room location.

When we first checked in i thought the rooms not so big and not as nice as other hotels we have stopped in but clean, fresh and comfortable.  We stayed in a city view deluxe with balcony, not many sea view rooms have balconys and for us a balcony is a must.  The view not so good and the balcony noisy because of air conditioning units.
But on saying this i have never come across more helpful, polite and genuine staff they cannot do enough for you.  The staff that entertain round the pool are amazing, they never stop and the kids love them.  If you are after a quiet pool this is not for you, loud music, games, pool volleyball, water polo, giant water balls, pool bar, basket ball net in pool i could go on.......but we found this very entertaining and spent a lot more time round pool than we usually would.
A member of staff told us what a great company hard rock was to work for and the opportunities the staff get are great.  One day we wanted a letter translating from english to thai and the staff on reception did this with no problem.
The location of this hotel is good for us, you are right on beach road within walking distance of central festival a great shopping mall and all of our favourite soi's you are on a baht bus route so cheap transport and right across from the beach.  Plenty of security on all gates so felt safe and sound.
The pool is lovely but one small complaint not enough sunbeds for amount of rooms in hotel, i think 100 sunbeds and 400 rooms, also you can pay to use the pool so outside guests can come in thus takin up more sunbeds.  Some days people had put towels on beds and we never saw them come back so a bit unfair for people wanting beds.

If you stay at the Hard Rock be prepared to pay high prices for drinks and food. No happy hours on cocktails etc and the competitor hotels nearby e.g. the Hilton and Holiday Inn both welcome happy hours 5pm-7pm. Lots of guests going out of the hotel to purchase food and drinks. Also be aware the hotel hosts private parties where the pool and hotel areas get sectioned off which I don't think it's fair when guests have paid for the full facilities. We did get an early check in on arrival which was much appreciated. Breakfast was basic not the standard we have been used to. Hard Rock food at the beach bar needs to improve vastly over priced. A beer was 295baht which the rate would make it £6.82 a pint. Never paid these prices in Sharm or Patong. Found a lovely restaurant for lunch called the Discovery Beach Hotel just to the right of the hard rock on beach road.

We were very pleased with our room; it had fantastic views (5th floor- but higher would probably be even better), and a stylish design.  It had a comfortable bed, nice bathroom, and all the amenities you need.  Getting a wifi internet connection is expensive though.  The breakfast is very good, with many delicious choices available.  Food in the hotel is generally pretty pricey, but we enjoyed the delicious, wood-fired pizza from their Italian restaurant.  Everything in the restaurants is also available from room-service for slightly lower prices.  
The Hard Rock property was great!  We really enjoyed the pool a lot.  The staff is friendly and fun; they organize games and activities like water volleyball, water basketball, & kayak races in the pool throughout the day.  There is also a sandy area of the pool which is very cool & different.  In fact, I'd say it's a little bit nicer than the beach across the street from the hotel because it's cleaner and shady.  They were renovating the water slide area during our stay, but kids will have fun with that when it's ready in a few weeks. One thing that I didn't really like about the pool was its tile bottom.  They've done a very nice job of laying the tiles so that they're not sharp (often a problem with tile bottomed pools) but there is a lot of algae growing on the grout in the spaces between the tiles.  It's not a big deal, but it makes the pool seem a little dirty, even though it's actually pretty clean.  
The Hard Rock is a great, family friendly oasis near the ""action"" of Pattaya.

When I asked him to stop he started threatening and abusing me. At this stage my daughter who was in a state of shock started crying so we turned away and headed to our room. I then immediately notified the duty manager who replied that they cannot stop people from drinking, it’s not their problem and basically there is nothing they can do about it, even though the same drunk guy still was roaming around in the lobby.  I understand that you can not babysit your guest but surely you can do something when they startharassing and abusing other guest.

The staff were the best they rocked for the whole time we where. They made the holiday. Every member of the hotel staff where friendly happy and always helping you.
The rooms where of good size clean and where all being done up. We had a seaview superior room which was lovely.
The location of the hotel is central and just a short walk to the department stores.
The hotel amenities where second to none 
The only down fall was we had to come home. No the foam party was a little busy and alot of young people where in the pool.

Check in seemed to take an age with even the minute details of the mini bar were spelt out – such as water in bathroom was complimentary but water in fridge was an extra charge.  And then we were given a room on a smoking floor despite answering the question about room choice three times that a non-smoking room was required.
Rooms are tired and showing their age, along with the bathroom showing signs of grubbiness.  Shower was poor due to blocked nozzles through lack of cleaning.
Breakfast was an … average choice, and incredibly noisy.  Although the staff were very efficient at seating, and clearing tables as well as ensuring the range of food was maintained, even pre preparing eggs and omelettes – a smart move.
Overall, it seems the hotel struggles to cope with the turnover and number of guests which seemed to be predominately families and Russians.

We were greeted warmly upon arrival and got impressed by its plush main lounge which combines stylish rock and roll vibe. Although the property is not a brand new one but decently maintained. We requested to provide us all four rooms on the same floor since we were travelling with friends, there was some confusion among hotel front staff and we were made to wait for some time and finally approached with ‘king club rooms’ which had separate beds. We decided to adjust and requested to combine the beds which a hotel staff had managed clumsily. Leaving aside the initial hiatus we were very impressed with the size of the room, styling and thematic room decor. Each room has a Philips media player and the hotel provides free Wi-Fi access. The breakfast spread was impressive with wide variety of choices. But since it is a big 350 room hotel the place gets crowded if you arrive a little late for breakfast. The pool is huge with a nice layout with different experience sections. A portion of the pool has an artificial sand beach with huts but I personally liked the wide and clean portion of the pool which offers space for all even if the pool is crowded. The iconic guitar neck mounted beside the hard rock café’ was going through some renovation and it was covered with a canvas somewhat diminishing the appeal of the building facade. The Hard Rock Store in the lounge sells the iconic Hard Rock logo –T-shirt and collectible pins, perfect souvenir to return home with. We were touring most of the time and missed the opportunity of spending time in the iconic Hard Rock Café which normally offers quality rock performances live!

Checked in within minutes and went straight to our room. I must point out that the view was terrible with a generator making a loud noise. As we were there for almost 3 weeks next morning we called and managed to get another room this time pool/sea view with balcony which made a world of a difference. 
Room wasn't nothing special pretty run down which definitely needs upgrading, room window hadn't been cleaned for months. Balcony was nice but didn't seem like it was cleaned much. Bathroom steams as no ventilation and very poor lighting. 
No where for the ladies to sit and do make up as there's no mirror on table you have to stand in bathroom which is annoying due to bad lighting. 
With our deluxe room we got the free access to the 9th floor lounge which was pretty poor you get a few juice options that's if they've decided to replenish the fridge and a few cakes or a dry sandwich, we also had the evening free drinks and canopy at the soul lounge 6-7.30pm which was same everyday. Mind you they were good to us and ordered different options if asked. Live singing Fri and Saturday in soul lounge but other days it's the same music which became boring. 
Restaurant is expensive and the choice isn't that great. We didn't do the buffet but it looked good. 
On a Saturday they do a BBQ where from morning the pig on the BBQ starts slow cooking for the evening not good to see or smell if you either a Vegetarian or a Muslim it smells the whole hotel out. 
We didn't eat at the cafe so cannot comment but we did drink a few beers there which was ok. 
The swimming pool is great for all ages. Saturday 6 onwards kids pool party, they looked like they were having fun. 9pm onwards for adults we went once bit of a gimmick nothing to shout about. You can easily spend a fair bit at the pool bar as it isn't cheap but that's expected at all hotels I guess. They have fun pools game most days which was fun. 
The staff from front door security right the way to room maids were all so welcoming and always smiled with a hello and always willing to help you no matter what time. 
The location is great and the beach is across the road and walking street is a 15 minute walk or a 2 minute 10 bhatt bus journey away.

The swimming pool area is large and cozy and also well suited for children. The bar in the pool area is very expensive and, for example, coffee and VSOP cognac cost nearly 20 euros.

We were there for 3 nights but only went to HRH on our last night there - we went w/out prior booking and would like to experience jumping from one hotel to another. We regret it so much as we discovered HRH offered so much for us to do and a very pleasant stay indeed. That Saturday night, there was this famous foam party going on and for those who prefer something 'milder' you can just laze about in the huge tempting pool and listen to the music. 
Even if you come with your family there are a lot of things to do for both adults and children. Im suprised to learn the extend of services/activities you have around - spa, rock climbing, water games for kids etc. Another important fact was, it was very affordable with B2222 for deluxe garden view and B2700 (about) for deluxe seaview. Services were great with very friendly staffs (who were ever ready to assist) attending to you wherever you go around the hotel.
We enjoyed our stay so much that my friends and I were contemplating coming back to Malaysia and were considering to stay there for another day or two, except that all of us would be working the next day..  
Although people say Pattaya is another Phuket (and I have been to both), staying at HRH makes a huge difference to all of us and I would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat.

The decor seems somewhat dated, I am a 60's lover but the hotel over states this, it's 2016-wake up to that.

We arrived quite late, around 2 a.m. and all I wanted was to put the kids to sleep. Check in was very fast, they had everything ready as we had advise we would arrive late. A staff took us to our room and almost at the same time another staff arrived with the luggage. They assigned room 908 to us, a nice number for Chinese people. 
I liked the fruit basket and the juice bottles and especially the milk that were on the table and that my kids drink as they arrived.
The kids got ready to bed, and my son turned on the lamp that was in the table and it exploded. Luckily he was on the bunk bed stairs and my daughter, who was going to sleep on the down bed, was not in the room. I was at the door and was a little scared by the noise as well as by all the glass that spread on the floor and told my son to climb to his top bed. We called to ask for someone to come and clean because the lamp exploded. They were very fast to send someone that arrived with another table lamp and looked around the room at all the glass on the floor and ask to use the phone. Almost after he put the phone down a “team” arrived at our room. The staff that had done the check in and took us to our room arrived also and when he looked around at all the glass he asked if we wanted to change room and we immediately agreed as it was quite late for the kids and would take some time to clean the glass from the carpet. They helped us change to room 936 and it was exactly the same as the other room.
This was an unlucky incident but everything was fast solved and luckily nobody got hurt.
The room is very nice and big and kids have their own space which is very good.
There are two toilets, one for the kids with shower only and another on the master room with a big bathtub and a shower compartment. 
The master room has a king size bed, a big closet to store the bags, with a safety box inside. There was also a desk and a flat screen TV.
The kids’ room is an insert in the “living room” and it has a bunk bed and there were two stuffed animals on each bed that my kids really liked and even wanted to bring home. Now, the bunk bed really fits the insert or maybe I should say the walls of the insert are built around the bunk bed and don’t go until the ceiling so that it can has natural light.
This room is recommended for kids until 12 years old, but the bunk bed is only 1.50 m long and my son is 10 years old with 1.52 m height, so he doesn’t fit well on the bed. The first night was quite late and he just tried to sleep the best he could in diagonal direction, but the other nights he slept in the sofa (long and wide). This made the cleaning staff confused and after that, they didn’t set my daughter bed (she slept on the top bed of the bunk bed), they just fold the blanket and left one on the sofa and the other on the top bed.
The entrance takes you passing the insert room and into the living room area which had a nice sofa, a round chair/leg rest and another chair, all very nice comfy. It has a refrigerator, coffee or tea kettle and cups, including two kids’ cups, X box and a flat screen TV.
My kids liked the X box but complained because there was not enough space as some of the games required they were far from the TV and they needed to be near the sofa and that was not in front of the TV but on the left side of the TV and sometimes it didn’t work well.
The room has two balconies, one in the master bedroom and the other in the living room, with seats outside, nice to enjoy the views.
It was also the first time we stayed in the King’s Club area, but in the main restaurant of ground floor provide much more variety of food, and we always had breakfast downstairs and not in the King’s Club Lounge. But we did go there two days at the end of the day for the snacks (very good quality snacks!) and it was very nice. Food was good and staff very nice. During the day, we sometimes pass there to have an espresso coffee and soft drinks.
Regarding Wi-Fi, my husband said it was a bit slow, not only on the room but in other parts of the hotel also.",SmasKim,Date of stay: February 2013,4,"Macau, China",Trip type: Traveled with family,4-Value,4-Rooms,4-Location,4-Cleanliness,5-Service,4-Sleep Quality,,

We were a bit disappointed by the ""extra charges"" for smaller games. There is a game room with table tennis and pool table and few playstation stations. To use this room you got to pay THB 250 per person and day. There is also a climbing wall for which you got to pay THB 80 per climb. During our stay we could not use the wall, because the staff was absent.
Overall a good hotel with nice pool directly located on the beach road. Central shopping mall or the famous walking street are within walking distance (10 min) or easy accessable via 20-Baht-Taxi.",Daniel,Date of stay: March 2014,4,Switzerland,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,null,null,null,null,null,null,,

The staff were simply fantastic, nothing was too much to ask and service was always with a smile. It can be hard to deal with large groups but the hard rock staff took it all in their stride. We had use of the King's Club Lounge which was well worth it as the communal dining area where breakfast was served was an incredibly loud, echoey space that wasn't great after indulging in the happy hour the day before. 
The hotel room was well equipped with two large single beds and comfy bedding. My only complaint was the lighting in the bathroom which wasn't great for putting on makeup etc. However this is really a very small complaint as everything else was completely faultless. 
The pool area is generous and well designed. The children's area can be easily avoided and food and drink can be ordered right from your sun lounger. After enjoying snacks at the happy hour including cheese (a treat when you live in Thailand) and then eating at the restaurant buffet we all attended the foam party which was so much more fun than I'd imagined. You can go in the pool and in the foam and it was really well organised. The bar staff were also super nice and tolerant of 50 something screeching women.

The hotel have a friendly staffs, very clean room, the facilities was good and the most important thing that is i can get my collections at the hardrock cafe. Well,15% discounted price because i booked via Hardrock website.
Don't trust all the travel website please, while you are booking thailand hotels, always go to the original hotel website and i guarantee you will get the best rate among the other websites.
One last thing im not really happy about it that is the hotel have different rate (cheaper) for only PRC & resident from Macao / HK to book via Ctrip.com. think they should apply to all neighbour country like Malaysia and Singapore. Guess what? Our spending power is not lesser than PRC / Macao / HK ! Just that our populations are lesser.
Hope the hotel can seriously consider this. Because of this different of rates that only makee stay 1 night here and going to centara grand mirages stays for the next 4 nights even the rates are much more expensive. But at least consistent and no different.

We got upgraded when we check in. The staff at receptionist is helpful and check in was fast.
The staff that sent our bag to the room (Kevin) is totally great, he did explain to us about attractions at pattaya and even gave me the map of pattaya when i asked him. And he told us about the jetski scam so we can avoid it. 
The room is newly renovated i think and it has the hard rock-ish design and amenities. The room feels good and airy with the balcony, but the wardrobe section could be better as its stuck on the corner with little space left to put your clothes. The bathroom is kinda old and the sanitary ware at the shower area looks like they need a change.
Bed is comfortable, and room service is quick and delicious. Its our anniversary trip and the hotel staff put flowers and a plate of strawberry chocolates with a greeting card so big thanks for that.
The pool is great and the breakfast is tasty, loved the thai noodle soup there.
Location is quite in the centre of pattaya, near some night market and central festival mall and a lot of eateries nearby
The downside is, that the front lobby feels so hot even at night time, maybe its because pattaya is hot or the air conditioner need an upgrade. And while some staff perform great and helpful, some are just plain, even when i smiled at them and thank them for doing something, no facial expression or smile back from them.

The fine attention to details make the Hard Rock Hotel a truly special hotel. I've been living and traveling throughout Thailand over the past few years. I've stayed in many hotels from a $11 a night budget hotels to some of the best 5-star resorts. The Hard Rock Hotel in Pattaya is one of my favorite places to be. If you've traveled in Thailand, you know that the service can be rough at times. Not at the Hard Rock. From the minute you step foot on the property the staff is there to greet you with a smile and attend to your needs.
We were fortunate enough to receive a Kings Club Seaview room. If you're traveling as a couple, a club room is completely worth the extra money. Many of the club rooms I've stayed at before are limited in selection and service but not here. You really don't need to eat outside of the hotel. And, from 6-7:30pm they offer free cocktails, beer and wine. 
The pool is probably the best feature of the hotel. The staff keep the pool and grounds exceptionally tidy and are always available to take your drink or food order. 
What impressed me the most was seeing the general manager everyday interacting with guests and staff. I had written him before my arrival to make him aware of the special family trip we were about to take. And, to my surprise, he had a complimentary bottle of wine and letter welcoming us. And, as I stated earlier, I've stayed in many hotels in Southeast Asia and around the world. Rarely does a general manager personally go out of their way to make a guest feel special. Mr. Smith is a class act and his generosity is greatly appreciated by myself and my family. 
Details matter when you're traveling. From the superbly comfortable beds to the music playing in the hallways the Hard Rock pays attention to details.

Overall there was nothing in particular that was very bad, however I expected a lot more from this hotel. Perhaps the hotel guests of whom 90% appear to be Chinese have different expectations? I have following points noted below that reflect my poor rating for this hotel.
- Hotel is generally a little shabby and needs updating. Examples: Pool around the bar area was very dirty with lots of particles floating around. My room had strands of hair in and around the bathroom.: Carpet in the elevator is dirty stained. I am sure I would have noticed more if the interior was not so dark.
- The service at the restaurant was very poor. I got my order processed OK, but there was no follow up. It had taken some time to get their attention when I needed something.

They were very apologetic and replaced the food...but that's not the point.
- Concierge arranged a taxi for me on departure. I specifically asked for a taxi that will run his meter. When the taxi arrived he already negotiated a 1,200 baht fare for a 25 minute taxi ride. I know I got ripped off but did not have the time to argue. Not sure if the concierge got a kick back or not? BTW my taxi ride from the Sheraton centre of Bangkok to the Hard Rock was 1,600 baht.

POOL: fabulous! large and different sections for kids,games and pros.best part is it closes at 10pm and there are 2 lifeguards all the way till closing time!

This hotel is in a great location.  The beach is across the street, walking street is just down the street, and all the shopping and food is just down the street.  The hotel is a little dated, but very well maintained and the grounds are amazing.  There were zero construction noises (a big win for anywhere in Pattaya), and the room was very clean.  The bed was comfortable, and the shower was amazing.  The room was very quiet, and the curtains easily darkened out the entire room.  Quite a peaceful place for being a Hard Rock, and right in the middle of the Pattaya nightlife. The absolute best thing about this hotel is the staff.  Several of them actually asked and remembered my name, shook my hand, and genuinely were kind, friendly, and helpful.  Wifi was great here too, in room and on site.
Only a few negatives I'd list for this hotel (why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars). I've eaten at 3 restaurants here.  All 3 were extremely expensive, but the quality was far from matching the price.  I understand pricey food for these properties in prime locations, but the quality should match.  Don't bother with Breakfast, saying it was mediocre would be a huge compliment, and was 400 baht per person.  The Hard Rock Cafe was the same way, friendly, amazing people, but expensive and questionable quality food.  The only other issue that I have is the plumbing.  No matter what you do in the toilet, it requires several flushes for it to go away, and most times it just didn't.  There is no bowl brush, or bum gun cleaner, so it's a bit of an experience.
Overall though, I had a wonderful time at this hotel, and the people really made me feel welcome here.  The pool and property is great, and the location can't be beat.",Jason B,Date of stay: March 2015,4,"Pattaya, Thailand",Trip type: Traveled solo,5-Rooms,5-Cleanliness,5-Service,null,null,null,,

The hotel assisted me by helping to arrange a private transfer vehicle for the nearly 2 hour journey from Bangkok Suvarnabumi Airport to the hotel.  The flight arrived early and still the transport was available to us a soon as we were ready for it.  On arrival at the hotel having paid for a Kings Club room there is the added benefit of personalised check in services.  The room was a lovely size although a little bit warm as it was facing into the sun for much of the day and has a lovely big window.
The staff were exceedingly friendly and soon knew the names of all of my family.  There is lots of music as would be expected at a Hard Rock venue and lots of fun things to do; listen to a band playing poolside, attending a foam party, zorbing on the pool, cocktail hour, games in the Kings Clubroom, spa facilities the list goes on.  
Outside the hotel it was easy to access lots of other things to do from spa type activities to watersports and elephant treking.  
For a last minute holiday this was certainly more than I had hoped that it would be and all with the added advantage of being in Thailand where the cost of living and entertaining is significantly less than the UK.

First impressions are very important, on the first of our two stays we were welcomed by ""Fluke"", nothing was too much trouble and he made us feel very welcome, we were taking my partners parents and brothers and sisters away following her graduation, mum and dad hadn't stayed in a hotel for 25 years. Fluke made them feel like stars, and we had a great stay.
The stay was great, every member of the team, check-in, cleaners, pool and restaurant staff all provided excellent service and helped us all enjoy our stay - thank you one and all.
On our first stay we had a city view room, lovely room, though I do like a sea view.
Our second stay was last minute, we were actually going somewhere else and changed our minds en-route, we booked via our smart phone through an agent, in fact we arrived so quickly the booking hadn't made it onto the system. That didn't phase the staff and we were soon in our room and onto the pool.
This time we had a sea view room, whilst I do love my sea view when they refurbished the rooms they seem to have made the rooms bigger by removing the balcony, I don't think that was a good move.
All in all two good stays, and look forward to our return in the not too distant future.
One thing worth of note, we were in the HRC All Access scheme which gave us a discount on food and merchandise, when we stayed over the Christmas holiday our discount was not given and we advised to sign up for the new HRC Reward Card. We duly signed up for the programme and presented our card for our points at the Hard Rock Cafe during this visit, our card was declined and were advised that Pattaya were not participating in the programme - it was still being advertised within the cafe though.",John S,Date of stay: April 2013,5,"Hua Hin, Thailand",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,5-Value,5-Rooms,5-Location,5-Cleanliness,5-Service,5-Sleep Quality,,

dollar! The hotel is centrally located in town across from beach and for shopping and nightlife. I booked the Composer 1 BDRM suite with airport car transportation for an additional charge. However, you can book a private car at the airport as well, but it made things much easier for my first time visiting. Arriving international flights expect a minimum 1HR to clear customs and immigration—ensure arrival customs arrival card is filled out in entirety before getting off plane. For planning, ride from airport to hotel was ~ 1HR-30MIN. Check-in was on the 9th floor in the Rock Royalty lounge (VIP), which provides light foods and refreshments throughout the day, followed by cocktail hour (6-7:30) in the evening—a must before going into town. The hotel offers unique bars, restaurants, and entertainment on site and gets quite lively in the evening. The pool area is spacious, reasonably so, with the bubble party every day Saturday—try it. The Spa services in the morning are refreshing after a late night in the town. Buffet breakfast is served in the lobby and Club level—excellent variety of tastes. The Rock Shop and Hotel shop have different souvenirs so ensure u visit both for exclusive merchandise.

All thier twins are queen size so can easily accommodate 2Ad & 2 Ch without an extra bed. 
Bathroom doens't have tubs. 2 drawbacks in the bathroom is that they only have big rain shower and they don't have normal shower so its quiet difficult for gals like us who doens't want to get hair wet during bath and 2nd is that the glass which spilt between the bath and toilet area is small so the water do go to wash basin and toilet area which makes the whole bathroom wet.

The sea-view rooms are spectacular. the hotel decor is typical of this chain of hotels.... rock n roll memorabilia, dark shades, iconic trademarks like guitars, rock star costumes, music channels streaming videos, music, rooms with personal mini hi-fi systems, foam parties in the pool & the hard rock cafe ( open from 1100 hrs till very early morning....playing excellent live rock music). The rooms are tastefully decorated albeit i would say that the maintenance was low.....(my shower broke down) the service was efficient , the mechanic fixed it in the next 30 mins but then i had to leave for my day trip in a hurry. The high point of the stay however was the food: a rockin choice of continental, Thai & Indian cuisine. The famed Hard Rock Cafe lives up to its reputation playing great live rock music. the pool is unique in its design with its own sand-beach. The meeting/conference rooms called ""the hall of fame"" are well equipped & also bear the typical dark furnishings associated with rockers but you find the staff is quite polite and can speak pretty good English which in Thailand is a definite advantage over many other hotels. All in all, the hotel provides quality service at a higher price.

Breakfast at the Kings Club was much quieter and a much smaller choice of food. The pizzeria was fantastic, particularly the calzone. Buffet dinner at Starz Diner wasn't anything special with many differing choices. The sundae bar was great and plenty of sweet choices for desert. The happy hour cocktails and food were amazing and each evening there was a different selection of food. The pool bar was a lot of fun, the staff were friendly and more than obliging and the cocktails were delicious. The pool area and sun lounges filled up very quickly each day and most afternoons there wasn't much of a choice if any where to park your towels and belongings.

They were friendly and even learnt songs that we requested during our stay. Each night they made an effort to greet all the diners and returning guests. They also made each and every person feel welcomed. This trip was for my Husband's 30th and the band made it a perfect holiday. 
The only negative experience we had was when checking out; we were told we had to pay for using the King's Club the few times we did. We explained numerous times that it was included in the package that we had booked. The staff refused to listen to what we were saying and look through the documents we were given by our travel agent. In the end we payed the extra as the taxi to take us to the airport was waiting. Once checked out and on the way to the taxi, the staff flagged us down and explained that we were right all along and that they would immediately refund our money. This took another 30 minutes, making us later than we wanted to be leaving as well as taking over 24 hours for the money to be refunded back onto our card.

The facilities are of a very good standard and the rooms especially; large, bright and modern. I really liked the bathroom and shower.

Staying for 10 nights over Valentine's this hotel really made our holiday special. The food throughout the hotel was excellent, from the breakfast buffet which appeared to have everything and was refilled very quickly, to Hard Rock Cafe food, which you can order pool side, we could not fault it. 
My partner had a birthday and the staff even surprised us with a cake and card on the day to our room. (Thank you Hard Rock)
We were based on he 8th floor choosing a Sea View, King bed and balcony at the front of the hotel. Not all rooms have a balcony or a King size bed, worth asking for on the booking comments and on arrival if needed, the staff were very helpful. We booked direct through their website....
http://pattaya.hardrockhotels.net
Choosing their 10 day early bird offer for us was discounted from other websites at that time and worth checking. We also emailed the hotel with the odd question and had a quick response.
I used their guitar Pick service, choosing a guitar for our room. Your credit card is required as a guarantee on any damages which you check for on arrival and return of the equipment as expected but an excellent service and unique service for a hotel.
The spar facilities were also excellent and when using the pool you can use their towel service and sign towels out with no charge as long as you return them instead of having to use your own, which made things a lot easier for us.
If choosing a Saturday night stay at the hotel there is a foam party with loud music from 9pm-1am. This happens only one night of the week so don't be put off.
If I had any small negative to our stay, it would be as a cider drinker the hotel did not serve any cider, but we found this to be a common thing in most bars in Thailand ..but hopefully they will catch up soon. We found a couple of Irish bars like Mulligans and Rosie o' Grady's have Magners or Kepplers in stock if you look for it and don't mind paying extra.
Overall we felt this was an excellent hotel and we would definitely stay at a Hard Rock Hotel again.

I informed the lady on reception that we would be willing to look at the room but also that we had already been wandering around Pattaya for 4 hours waiting to check in. She asked us to sit down and then after just a short time returned offering us an upgrade and an apology. Upon entering the room we were amazed. The shower was huge, the décor was beautiful and the bed was large and comfortable. The fridge was stocked full, and the carpet felt beautiful to walk on. The porter brought our bags up promptly and left without looking like he expected a tip... which made me call him back and tip him more than I would have originally. It was then on to the pool area, which had beautiful Cabanas, was very clean and had staff constantly walking around read to fetch your drinks or food.

To take the good things first. This hotel is a fantastic hotel, you get a truly international feeling when you stay there, and it does not feel like thailand at all (I mean this in the good sense). The rooms are nice, the food is good, and the swimming pool and foam party for the kids is really the best in the area! BUT.
I do NOT expect to find used band-aid in my bed. this is truly discusting, and took away the magic of the clean room right away. The bed was replaced within 15 minutes, and that is good, also the management listen to my complaints the next day, and said that this will looked in to. but one of the ""stars"" in my ratings was taken away because of this.
Also, their pool, like mentioned is very very nice, and perfect for little kids who want to have a good time. But their two life guard stations are facing the deeper end of the pool, and not a single life guard faces the 3 slides that are in use by all the youngest people there. My 3 year old, was going down one of the slides by her self, only to smash into another older kid walking up the slide... the crash took her down, and only because I rush to the scene did she not go to the bottom of the pool. They have a rule against running up the slides, but no life-guard or staff to enforce this. also since so many kids play in the pool with out supervision, I think they should have one staff looking at this area of the pool alone. and I have told them this. I took 2 more stars from my review, not only because this is dangerous, and we had a bad experience, but also because their pool manager gave me excuses, and did not see this as a problem.  later another manager told me that they would look into this, but that remains to be seen. 
I would have gladly given 5 stars for this hotel experience, but sadly I can not. I am not sure if I will go back. 
some other notes:
-going to the pool I asked 3 different staffs where I can find the towels... not one of them could help me, only another guest helped me.
-getting service at the pizzaria is quite hard, I had to walk to get help all the time. but the pizza was very good.

Since I needed to leave for work before 8am I was running outside in the 90/100degF heat. 
Other than the gym times, the room was very nice and comfortable. They have lots of outlets to charge your devices and the room comes with 3 500mL bottles of water. The shower was nice but i couldn't get the rain style shower head to work right. The cell phone they give you was super nice perk and honestly a deciding factor for the hard rock. The phone has excellent data connection and you can take it with you on your travels to make local phone calls (think taxi or restaurants) and it has maps on it (so you never get lost).

Reading the reviews one was the ""dirt lot"" in the view.  The hotel next door went out of business and their pool and dirt is unkempt.  Not sure how Hard Rock can be held accountable for this...although I do recommend purchasing the lot and expanding the Hard Rock.
     Room service menu was extensive and the Madras Curry was top level great!
poolside service was excellent.  Drinks were mixed well.  Pool not overly busy.  A slight problem with people dropping towels on beds all day even when not there but we managed to find a spot without problems every day.  Just the best seats taken sometimes for most of the day without people coming back to them.
     Pool party on Saturday night was pretty awesome.  
     Location is fantastic.  1km from walking street.  many eateries and pubs within 5-10min.  once you figure out the 10baht shuttles on the street transport is no problem.  Taxi drivers gouge you for 200bht from walking street back when very late night...but really...that is $7usd...and you can walk in 20min should you not wanna pay.
     Cannot mention enough how nice the staff was.  Security guy sees you coming and presses elevator door for you.  everyone holding doors for you, service you actually don't get at some 5 star locations.
     So yeah, great bang for the buck.  food prices reasonable.  None of the problems faced in any complaints.   Only issues...left our door open and a bird flew in and snatched food off the counter...twice.   so seems he has it down.   And the part of the pool nearest beach had a lot of gnats and flies. Had a faint smell of refuse.  Did not notice that second day so think related to garbage day or similar?
     We'll certainly stay again next year's vacation.
     The hotel arranged car service is fairly inexpensive however you can walk up to the road near the 7-11 and the taxis there will get you to BKK for 1200Baht, 1500 if you need the mid sized car...just walk up there and tell them what time you wanna leave and they come right to the hotel door.",Jason R,Date of stay: March 2019,5,"Glen Mills, Pennsylvania",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,5-Rooms,5-Location,5-Service,null,null,null,,

well, what a wonderful welcome on the 9th floor. Absolutely spot on!  Fantastic welcome, professional staff, friendly, and so pleased to see us!  perfect!!
book a kings club floor!  worth the little extra, and the service is fantastic!  the GRO's are wonderfully friendly, ever so helpful and such... could not do enough for all guests (including a very rude and large family with three kids who had the GRO staff running around for sandwich after sandwich after sandwich.. unreal!)....
breakfast fab, cocktails (arrived late each day as been out) were a great also, but there are some greedy guests haha.. but as included, well that is to be expected l guess.....
sadly, the swimming pool is in need of a very good deep clean.. the centre of the pool has debris on the floor, dirty tiles and the sun tan oil is present on the surface in parts of the pool areas...the locker rooms could be a bit more cleaner too, some stronger disenfectant cleaner would not go a miss to give it the shine/freshness as last time we stayed there.
the resort could do with a good big cleaning day - walkways to pools, stones in the pools across from sunlougers to the spa/shower rooms etc.. but overall great again..
activities galour; the construction work on the famous guitar was nicely covered up and no noise at all, so no worries there...

We arrived in Bangkok on the 19th so it was good that we got out asap!. Everyone was so nice and friendly at the HRH, we got up to our room quickly and the luggage soon followed. We had a pool view room and had 2 double beds which was great! The rooms are small but there was still heaps of room for us to spread all our shopping around. 
Breakfast was fantastic! heaps of variety and on 2 days we left before 6:30am so they made us breakfast boxes with a sandwich, water, orange drink, some pastries and fruit. 
The pool was awesome! With a beach section and a trampoline in the middle of the pool. Saturday night's foam party was so much fun! Thankyou to the Thai government for lifting curfew just in time! Also on the Friday they had a pool party and all the staff came our and were dancing to YMCA, quite entertaining.
It's walking distance to Central Festival and Royal Garden Plaza shopping centres, and also a Big C if you want groceries.

Mainly chose this hotel to experience it again after a few years and because of the kid activities and the Kids wanna Rock rate included breakfast for 2 adults and 2 children plus 2 hours play time in the Lil Rock play lounge so seemed like a good deal compared to others like Holiday Inn and Amari.
Arrived just after noon and at front desk they checked our passports and than we were escorted to the lounge as the Composer suite is on the King's club level which now is called Rock Royalty floor and rooms. Took a while to check in at the lounge as there is only one person working at the desk and there were several people checking out. But my kids raided the cake spread after the long trip so it wasn't all bad :)
The lounge itself is all right. Sandwiches, soft drinks, coffee, pastries and some cakes all day and cocktail hour from 6-7:30pm. It is not very large but was never very busy either so was ok.
We were in our room by 1pm so early check in and also arranged for a late check out at 2 pm included in the Rock Royalty room rate.
The suite itself is quite large with a huge sofa in the living room that can comfortably sleep 2 adults and the bedroom has a big king size bed which i found very comfortable. There is a small toilet near the room entrance and a larger bathroom with a shower and a very big bath which takes forever to fill up :)
There were also 2 balconies one overlooking the pool and has a sea view. The other looks to the side toward Central festival/Hilton and all the way down beach road towards walking street.
Also all per per view movies were free so that was nice. Not sure if all rooms or just some offer this for free.
The Pool is really nice and has a small beach and you can rent some cabanas on the beach side of the pool for 1000 per day. My wife just went down with kids and sat on one of those and without asking they started bringing drinks and just later did she find out it was a 1000 charge. It's ok we used it for the whole afternoon but should have been told this before the free drinks are served so she could make that choice.
I do recommend this for families as both adults and children have plenty to do. Lot's of things do require some extra payments and are not included in the price like the kids lounge, floaters for the pool, ping pong, pool table etc all are about 100 per hour per person.
I also visited the hard rock cafe that evening for dinner and at about 22h there were only 2 other tables occupied so i kinda enjoyed that as i was expecting a crowd and it to be loud.
The breakfast was both served at the Lounge and downstairs at the Starz restaurant. We chose to eat downstairs as the selection was bigger but also a bit crowded but not too much to make it uncomfortable.
That day still used the pool and checked out at 2pm which was also done at the lounge so my kids could have some more cake before we leave hehe
Overall i'm quite happy with our stay and actually might come again next week. The plus were the staff who all spoke very good English and very friendly.
I guess if there is something i would mention the door of the shower (room 924) does not close very well so water gets out. Also if you use the shower head in the bath the water will be everywhere. And perhaps a bit longer check in at the lounge which took about 30 min could have been done at the reception in less than 5 but you do get free cake ;)
P.S. There was a mix up with the rate i booked so once my wife wanted to use some of the perks included in the room rate they just said now she has to pay. But a quick visit to the front desk and some intervention from the Foreign lady at the front desk it was quickly fixed. I just recommend to bring out a print out of your reservation or email on your phone so you have some proof that you actually booked the rate and room but that goes for any hotel.

At first, it seemed like a crowded and noisy place but after all, it wasn't. I had my best time there in the swimming pool. There are about 4 swimming pools, and my favorites was one of the kids swimming pool which had sand instead of the ground and slides, and the other one was the big swimming pool. I liked the big swimming pool because instead of just swimming in the water, the hotel staffs would set up a game once in about 30 minutes. For example, there was bingo, and people would just gather up and EVERYONE could play. My favorite one was walking on wiggly steps from one end of the swimming pool to other end because I got second place and they gave me a prize! Also there was soccer(with hands). There is a pizza restaurant near the pool so I got to eat pizza while swimming.

The hotel is nice, clean, and has an awesome pool. I had a group of about 25 people and the hotel staff had no problem getting us checked in quickly and without issue. Here are some of the things I liked about the hotel:
The rooms are very nice. I guess the place had been recently renovated, and I must say they did a great job. The bathrooms were very stlyish and had an awesome and huge shower. 
The hotel restaurants facilities were nice and offered enough variety to suit most people's tastes. Each morning a breakfast buffet is provided and had sufficient variety that I was not bored with it by the tenth day. There is also of course a Hard Rock Cafe attached to the place, but I rarely ate there. My friends and I actually spent most of our lunches at the outdoor cafe downstairs by the pool area. Their pizzas were very very good. Drinks by the pool can get pretty pricey, so we often just raided our minibars since they were significantly cheaper. BTW, a 4 pack of Sing Has only cost 128 baht across the street at the Family Mart. 
The hotel had a sufficient amount of entertainment as well. The staff there would organize pool volleyball and pool basketball games which were a lot of fun. Be warned though, if you beat them they won't actually buy you drinks even though that's what they wagered. But it was fun nonetheless. On Fridays the hotel throws a foam party. The one I went to was a lot of fun, but I think that had much to do with the tons of Russian girls that were staying in the hotel. Either way it's worth checking out. Just don't go until about 11pm when the party really gets started.
The guest here tended to be younger and more fun people to be around. This was a favorite hotel for families. In contrast the guests at the Marriott tended to be more older fat guys and their Thai girlfriends/boyfrieds, and fewer people in the 20-35 age. 
Things I did not like about the hotel:
The location of the Hotel is fair. It was quite a walk down to walking street, but still very easy and cheap if you simply took a baht bus. Otherwise you can walk through a gauntlet of vendors and bar girls trying to get you to buy stuff or visit their bars. On one instance we literally had girls jumping on our backs trying to get us into the bar. The place is real close to soi 6, though, if you don't feel like heading to Walking St. The shopping near the hotel was pretty decent, but know that the prices are generally better at the stores away from the beach area. My favorite was the location of the night bazaar (which was also open during the day). They seemed to start out with better prices and were more willing to haggle there. 
The internet was very difficult for us, and was not what I would expect at a hotel of this quality. Firstly, you're only issued one code for the internet. This means you can only have one device at a time on the internet. Not a terrible thing, but still annoying. Add to this with the fact that the internet was down about 20% of the time during my stay. It seemed that just when it was most critical for me to get onto the internet it was down. The staff blamed it on Pattaya's internet being unreliable, but I stayed a few days at the Marriott and had no such issues. 
All in all I would stay at the Hard Rock again if need be, but would prefer the Marriott if I had the option.",filafella,Date of stay: May 2012,3,filafella,Trip type: Traveled on business,4-Value,4-Rooms,3-Location,4-Cleanliness,4-Service,4-Sleep Quality,,

Booked rock royalty and upgraded to pool view upon check in.

Check in process is on the rock royalty floor. The staff were lovely and gave a personal touch by welcoming me back.
A personalised card was also in the room, welcoming me for being a returning customer.

It was lovely to be back, especially after a few days on Koh LAN, this place feels like home!

I really can't fault this place! The location is perfect, if you want to go to walking street, take the baht bus. Access to the hotel is from beach road and second road. Close to central festival, and short baht bus to terminal 21.

My friend fell in love and said it was the best hotel of the trip and we stayed at other resorts within Thailand. 

Pool staff were great fun and engaging, although it was quiet compared to the time I visited in March, they still made an effort to engage with guests.

We were given rooms on the 8 floor with sea views and balcony. The rooms with balcony aren't large so if you need more space then don't opt for the balcony.

The service from Kin was amazing. He helped us bring our luggage up and even gave us a map and asked us what we would like to do in Pattaya. Based on our interests, he make a few suitable recommendations. How's that for service! Thanks Kin!

The buffet breakfast was average. Enough variety and quality was okay. The room service was good and recommend the oxtail soup, pad thai and chicken tenders. 

The kids club only takes ages 3-12. So my 2 year old missed out. It's more a kid minding room rather than a proper kids club with hourly activities. The staff were pleasant and our 6 year old enjoy himself. 

The pool is lovely, especially the three slides for kids, suitable for different ages. The sand area at the pool is great for kids who love sand castles. 

Overall a good stay. 

Just a tip - if you book airport transfers pls be very specific about which airport and also if its international flight or not. The person we spoke to almost booked us to the wrong airport and also the wrong time.

From a huge pool to kids slides to jaccuzi to pool bar! They have everything! They even have pool games. We don't leave the Hotel at times and just chill around the pool area. The Hotel is right across the sea and a few steps away from the shopping area, street bars, massage centers. There is easy access to public transport and you can also rent a car from the Hotel. Their staff is extremely helpful and guides you for any query that you may have. I love the breakfast and so do my kids.They have a foam party over the weekends for kids and adults. Kids foam party is in the evening and after that is adults turn so everyone gets to enjoy. When you book the room don't forget to ask for a sea view room preferably with a balcony.

Staff were very polite, but English was a communication problem. Nevertheless it's part of the experience of travelling.

Hard rock Pattaya is located in downtown Pattaya, where all the clubs, bars, restaurants, massage parlors, and malls are located. This was very convenient. Taxi was cheap, but the real experience is in the motorbike taxis (you really must try them!).

The room I got had a nice touch that reminds me of the American rock 'n' roll themes back in the 80s. It would get noisy at night at times with doors opening and closing, however it's a hotel in a busy location so what do you expect.

Nevertheless, the hotel is a must visit if you ever come to this side of Pattaya city.

This place in no way compares with Hard Rock Bali.. so if that's your measuring stick, forget this place. The room are tiny (Deluxe Sea View Room - with smelly toilets, cheaps out on toilet tissue, no face cloths) with two ""queen"" beds more like ""doubles"" and the hotel charges for EVERYTHING else. The activities are very poor by comparison with Bali (and even charges for floatation devices for your kids = 10 dollars a day). The draught beer is Singha (one of the the local beers - IMO not good - no Heineken draught), it is overall very disappointing. Now, to give the owner a bit of a break.. I think part of the problem is that their Chinese cousins (most Thai business owners are Thai-Chinese) are Chinese mass tour group tourists filling rooms, so the Western Hard Rock thing kind of slips away to cash in on the Wei!

Improvements have been made in the room with the showers and you no longer have to step into the tile bin so to speak.  The lighting however is poor and very hard to see in the mirror, etc.  Front entry of hotel and corridors are nice.  Other areas of rooms have modest changes. I understand that many rooms have been expanded in space, but I still prefer a balcony and the space dedicated to have one.
Bedding is still decent.  One thing that has not been improved is the TV can not accept A/V components so you can not watch from your Ipod, Ipad, etc. Most hotels everywhere have this ability, but not at HRH Pattaya yet.  
Breakfast Buffet seems to be unchanged and is still good value if included with your rate.  That said, there were some unwanted little critters I noticed near the fruit area.  It's consistent I guess with the climate and region so I just shrugged it off.
Pool area is the winning component of this property and what has always brought me back.  This time, however, I found the service so slow that it was a constant struggle to get a drink or food at times.  Very, very slow.  We rented a cabana one day and that is a great deal - do it!  Chairs around the pool are at a premium and yes, on the weekend especially, they are hard to get.  The hotel sells day passes and this does not bode well for paying guests who want a chair to lounge and sun.
The prices both on the website and via contacting the hotel seem to be increasing by significant margins.  I am finding it hard to justify nearly $200 US per night to return and given the crowds, the main draw of the pool is turning into a challenge that I do not welcome.  Another little side note is the 15% coupon given at check-in. It is for 15% off at Hard Rock Cafe Restaurant or Shop.  On our departure morning, knowing the shop by the restaurant was not open until later in the morning, we went to the shop at the lobby to make our final t-shirt purchases. The coupon was not honored because it was not the shop at the restaurant.  Really?  Without being told the guests are supposed to make that deduction?  It is not the same revenue center at the end of the day? I thought that was pretty petty and to be honest, the staff did not seem to think anything of it.

From the moment you walk in, you are greeted by the ever so friendly staff.  I was immediately recognised by several staff and their warmth and hospitality was greatly appreciated.  I was awarded an upgraded room instantly.  I was genuinely touched by this gracious offer.  I can not speak highly enough of the staff here.  At every turn, there is always a staff member eager to help you or just to say hello.  The rooms are spacious, well presented and clean.  The housekeeping service is awesome and they are always avaiable to help wherever they can.  The buffet breakfast is one of the best i have seen anywhere in the world.  The variety is endless.  They cover all bases from Asian to Western inspired foods and everything in between.  I couldn't imagine anyone being disappointed with what is on offer.  The pool is huge and very clean.  A great way to spend a day there is just simply relaxing by the pool.  Once again, there is always a staff member there to wait on you.
I experienced the Rock Spa for the first time.  The massage was very professional and relaxing.  I thoroughly enjoyed this.

Location is fine, on ""Beach Road"" and about 30 min walking distance from ""Walking Street"".
Check-in process was fine, we first made a stop at the ground floor for ID verification and welcome drinks. We were then escorted very nicely by a staff called Paris to the Clubs VIP lounge on the 9th floor for Club Guest check-in where we had to wait for about 15min before being attempted.
Ralph, the man in charged was very helpful and I drove me to upgrade from Kings Club Rooms I booked online to a Composer Suite and cannot complain as the Suite was nice and had a beautiful view on Pattaya Bay.
First attempt at the pool restaurant was not so good as the food was not to comment. Staff was nice and friendly. Room was quiet at night time and my sleep was good.
Next day, getting  sun-beds in the crowded swimming pool was a bit more complicated but after some efforts and some time we finally got the three beds we needed and could enjoy a very noisy atmosphere, with loud music and kids playing all around.
On the next day I got a bad experience at breakfast time.  Staff at Club lounge where not friendly and they only think about the money they could charge. I then decided to go for international buffet at the pool level restaurant but found doors closed at 10:30 and 10:33 was not permitted...
A believe my bad experience came from the staff at Club Lounge. Indeed, Ralph, the thai manager was the only contact being very helpful and friendly. The staff at ground level was well trained as well at check-out time and nice to deal with. Anyway,  I decided to check-out earlier and to move on another experience in the Pattaya lodging adventure.
Final question: Will I go back to this Hard Rock hotel Pattaya ?
Well,  I don't think so as the  service & feeling was well bellow expectation.

Booked my room via Agoda quite a few months in advance. Upon check in I was advised that my booking was cancelled by agoda although the payment was taken out.
I was extremely stressed and the lady at reception advised that she will contact Agoda however made me sign a document that I will pay for the room at the going rate and offered another room on level two.

I contacted Agoda who then provided me with another number which was in Hard rocks system. I'm not sure why this wasnt found by searching my name but finally was relieved that the booking was found.
It was clear that I was extremely stressed and was offered a wet towel and drink as my emotions took the best of me.
Reception advised our initial room wasnt ready and if we were happy to stay in the room on level 2. I stayed in level 2 as I was too stressed to pack up and move. Although reception tried to comfort me by saying everything is fixed no need to worry, I found this to be even more upsetting as I felt my feelings were not warranted, never less I decided to stay in the room to unwind. The tv froze, called reception who sent someone to fix it.
I was excited to see free movies as the last two places we stayed in had no English channels.
The TV's need replacing. The pixels have darkened so it looks like there was stains on the tv, and the movies always shuttered.
The room was near these loud fans from the building next door, did not sleep. Advised reception the very next morning and they moved us to a room on level 9.
If i am ever to come back to Pattaya I will certainly stay here again however will book pool or beach view to minimize the sound.

The facilities here is lovely.
Plenty of activities by the pool for families, food was great and my son still talks about the Power mocktails that was available at the pool bar.

He hates travelling however this place he enjoyed thoroughly. We ate from all restaurants including the cafe.
Buffet is awesome, plenty of variety, pizza was great from the pizzeria and my son enjoyed the burgers from the cafe.

So we have to go to Pattaya from Suvarnabhumi airport by taxi for THB 1400 include for express way. Actually if you can take the shuttle bus, you only need to pay THB 106. It will take around 2 hours to get to Pattaya. But then, when we arrived to Hard Rock hotel, suddenly we felt homy. They greated us by name, since we're the last guest at that day (we arrived at the hotel at 11pm). They really know how to treat their guest like a real star. Please send my regards to Tommy at the front desk.

The room is quiet spacious and clean with a comfy bed.
Breakfast is ok, but the same varieties everyday.
The swimming pool is very big and they have so many activities everyday, such as water aerobic, golf, wall climbing, etc.
Service is just average for me, because not all of them can speak English well.

This hotel is near to  Alcazar show, around 10 minutes walk, and to Tiffany's show, around 15 minutes walk. They have a transvestite cabaret show. It costs around THB 600-850 for VIP seat, but make sure you choose middle seat, so you can see the show clearly. Maybe it's quiet expensive, but i think it's worthed. You won't believe that all of them are men. They are so cute, beautiful and girly. It is a very entertaining show.

Because we already had a hotel with a infinity pool in Bangkok and we wanted a holiday feeling we booked the Hard Rock hotel.

******
Staff

The staff is all friendly and professional, reception personnel speaks good and understandable English. Most others don't.

Big plus for the animation team, and the staff at the Hard Rock Café (especially the big dude) 

*****
Security

I do need to make a seperated topic on this, because security was a joke. On first sight we thought we were driving to an embassy or something. We approached the gate with our taxi and the security guard made the stop sign. Then another security guard came to check underneath the car with a mirror.... It was a complete joke, it really was.  I do understand security but then do it correctly. 

Don't make a show out of it.. If you gonna check the car underneath with mirrors you need to do a full sweep of the car, also the luggage and everything..  Cause that's the only thing they do, they wall around the car with a mirror.. That's if, no need to open the windows or anything....

Next to that security I feel security is a really unnecessary thing when it's performed the way I watched it being performed during my total stay of 12 days at this hotel, not only at the entrance. The guards are very friendly, thats not really the issue though..

*****
Rooms 
Rooms are nice, comfortable beds.. We had a nice balcony with Seaview.

Bathroom needs a renovation.

*****
Pool

Amazing pool, really made our holiday. Got cleaned very good every day. Temperature is nice. 2 pools, one with sandpool and the main pool was a normal build pool. 

The sandpool has a swim up bar in it. We also attended to a pool parted that was held. There was a live music band scheduled at 07.30, it never showed up.. We waited for hours and at 09.30 a live band finnaly came through, but it wasn't any good.. 

******

Dining

We booked with breakfast, which was well equipped, and had enough choice for everyone. 

Don't have experience with the buffet that is being offered at the hotel. 

Snacks are Allright, nothing amazing or really outstanding. Was expensive though. 

******
Prices 

Hotel rate is good. Prices of the drinks are way overpriced especially for Pattaya means, it's allmost insane. And it's also a missed opportunity... I'm 100% sure that hotel guest would use much more beverages from the hotel itself if it was cheaper... Prices are 150/200% higher than sales in supermarket and 100/150% higher than the surrounding bars. 

We got our drinks at the 7/11 opposite of the hotel and drinkend them at the pool since we already had a hotel bill of 8000 baht that for 90% only consist out of drinks. 

For example we stay at a 5 star hotel in the middle of Bangkok now and the drinks are even cheaper here.. 

*****
Hardrock Cafe 

The hard Rock cafe is great, they serve many beers and have a nice airco to get away from the heat now and then. 

On Monday there is a great band with a nice volume to listen too. Rest of the week another band performs which is also a very good and professional band, but the music is way to loud when they perform, talking isn't possible due to the amount of decibels comming towards you. I would recommend lowering the sound for a bit. 

******
Overall

I'm really sorry my review is not as good as I wanted it to be. Don't get me wrong, we had a great stay at you're hotel. But looking back, I think some changes should be made to make this hotel a worthy 4 possibly 5 star hotel again....

Things that really should be addressed are the show that the security is performing, prices of the drinks, and if you host a show or event.. Make sure the time table is good and don't let people wait hours for a band that isn't comming..

However over the last few years the food g has been on av stay decline to the point that we no longer easy the buffet breakfast which to be quite honest is awful.... If really don't know what's happened but if you like good value did and drinks, don't stay here... 

I currently have a booking for the beginning of April however we are looking to change hotels for better quality in f and b.

A recent stay at another local hotel showed how bad the food actually was at hard rock. For the price paid, I certainly expect a better quality product at all times of the day and I certainly don't agree with 130++ for a can of singha available outside for 33 baht.

This has also coincided with a change of senior management about five years ago...  

I just hope the pool staff don't change as they are the one thing that keeps us coming back.

To add though. You really should clean your pool this visit it was disgusting.

The rooms were clean and spacious .
The pool is very big and there are plenty of beds. The boys were ecstatic when they saw the pool basketball net.
What made this hotel brilliant was that whilst you lounged around the pool, they had pool activities, such as polo,  aerobics, basketball etc,. The staff were not in your face and they did not force anyone to take part. The activities did not interfere with your peace around the pool. Our kids had great fun and it kept them occupied!. 
There is a room for the kids (forgotten the name ) which you pay 200bht a day to go in. It has a pool table, X-box games etc. This was a good retreat from the sun for the kids. 
I cannot critic this hotel . It is in a perfect location just across from the beach . The staff are fantastic and genuine. 
The management of this hotel are doing something right, because I have not got one complaint about any of the staff, they were fantastic and the service given was always with a smile!
The breakfast is fabulous, so much to choose from. 
ONE SUGGESTION - Pattaya is cleaning up it's act, but there is hardly any family friendly entertainment at night - it would be good if there could be nightly entertainment for families in the hotel. I am sure this would be well supported by people staying in the hotel and draw in others.

This stay was a family trip to Pattaya. My boy was all 100% enjoying the hotel facilities. He loved the music theme hotel, the room entertainment and the swimming pool. I personally love the gym. My wife loved the spa in the hotel, which there was a spa promotion package in the month of August.
This time got a Fender guitar up to my room from a good selection of Fender guitars and bass. This service has no cost, but a deposit is necessary. That's pretty fair, with the guitar and floor amp and stuff, really good equipment. My boy had lots of fun playing the guitar in the room.
The hotel is in good location, easy access to tourist attractions along the beach road.
Food was great, breakfast buffet was plenty to go around. The BBQ dinner buffet looks good too
Wifi was poor, but we were informed by the reception when we check-in, that's ok
I had no hot water one night, I guess that's because the Foam party just finished and hotel guests are taking shower at the same time. I did not encounter this problem on the other nights.
Great housekeeping team, room gets cleaned up very quickly and neatly. Good Job!
The remote for the sound system in the room has no battery, I guess this is the only fault I find in this hotel. The staff should check this regularly as it is stated in the website as one of their main in-room amenities.

The thing is it kinda feels like it's not terribly authentic - kinda slapped across a standard beach resort... perhaps this is what has happened. Strangely - the entertainment club is right next door and you get the feel it's run as a separate enterprise from the hotel and with lots of street traffic walking in perhaps this is the case as well.

I would say the pool is one of the best I have seen in a hotel for kids to play at and adults to swim, relax, drink, or eat.  I was amazed at how clean the water was when I went for a swim in the late afternoon.  Thanks to the pool maintenance staff for keeping the pool looking so good and the water crystal clear, even after a full day of kids and adults using it.  I stay in a lot of hotels, and many very nice, but generally in the afternoon the water gets a bit cloudy as the filters can't keep up with the people using it or the chemicals are not properly balanced,  This was not the case at the Hard Rock in Pattaya.

So booked a room online as it was a great deal. 
Arrived at the hotel car park full so had to park in the other one which is far from the hotel. Check in which takes around 20 minuets !! Got to the room very small and a bad smell from the poorly designed bathroom. Then had to wait 20 minuets for my luggage.
On the plus side the bed was great as was the housekeeping .
Breakfast is downstairs in the buffet restaurant good selection but room too hot and staff too slow. One day I arrived late around 1025 and they told me I only have 5 minuets to eat !
Really 5* so I didn't bother trying the other outlets. But on the 2nd night found the cafe, what a difference staff great and fun. The band new colour were great too. Better than the other bars in Pattaya. They even came to my table to say hi. Look out for joe the guy with the dreads such a cool guy. The food is American and just what I had needed but be warned the burgers are big. I ended up spending the rest of my stay at the cafe. You must really check out the band as they are great.
Day 3 had a massage which was fantastic best massage I had in pattaya well worth paying a little bit more. 
So all happy and well until check out. The guy behind the counter was not interested and took so long. When I said I was in a hurry he just looked at me.

I must say that it didn't start off well. Firstly the hotel staff didn't give us a free upgrade even though it stated that they would if you book directly from their website. 
Also I booked around 3 months in advance and was not told at anytime during my correspondence with the hotel that the pool would be partially close  ( as in the children's section of the pool).
But thanks to Ann ( Manager), she managed to get us connecting rooms and smoothen things out for us.
I noticed that the staff (the one initially attending to me in particular) at the reception tend to treat the Caucasians and the Asians differently. This was not the case in our previous visits. So I hope that they treat all guests equally. 
That said , the staff at the restaurants and swimming area were great and the kids enjoyed their stay 
Rooms at the Hard Rock are small. I think what keeps me coming back is the pool ( and do please tell us the renovation period ), and the interaction between staff and guests.
Once I don't get treated right , I will just move to newer hotels.

Checked in on the Saturday night (July 28th) and after exploring walking street for a short time returned back to partake in the foam party next to the pool. Decent music, good crowd and all the staff at this event were very friendly and made it a really good night. 
The concierge staff in general were very helpful in organising a trip to Koh Larn (Definately do and rent a scooter and get to the lookout on top of the mountain!), parasailing, Tiffanys show, Sanctuary of truth and even had a contact for jetski rental that wont scam you (NEVER RENT A JETSKI OR GO ON A TOUR FROM THE BEACH MERCHANTS IN PATAYA) and were able to tell us DO NOT SPEND MORE THAN 20 THB PER PERSON PER TRIP ON THE UTES WITH SEATS ON THE BACK!

The overall services from the staff was great for the exception of their house keeping and Wifi service.  
My wife called house keeping for new towels and was told the staff will be right up.  Ten minutes later my wife called again to remind them and was told the same thing.  Now twenty minutes have passed and no sign of house keeping so I walked down to the front desk to inform them about the issue.  The front desk called house keeping and told me they'll bring it.  I got back to the room told the wife what the front desk said.  She got in the shower, minutes later house keeping shows up.  It took them 25 minutes to bring up two towels.  Another issue we had was when I called and request for some ice in the evening.  House keeping told me they'll bring it up.  They never showed up and we end up falling asleep.  
The wifi was expensive for the slow and inconsistent service it provided.  We paid for the week that was 1500 Baht.  Only to find out that we were allow one username and password.  Now both of us are taking online classes and needed wifi on both of our laptops.  After having the front desk talk to the manager, they gave us a second account as a complimentary.

The sea view room was way better as it was bigger and had the view of the sea. The only thing was that we sometimes smelt cigarette smoke and it could be due to people smoking?
Chloe from the Rock Royalty lounge helped us make the change of rooms.
We enjoyed our visits to the Rock Royalty lounge everyday. The food was excellent, with cocktails and drinks in the evenings, while watching the sunset. We must say that it is thanks to team members like Chloe and Ik Kew who made all the difference! We were glad we booked the Rock Royalty room.
We enjoyed our buffet breakfast at the Starz Diner everyday, except one day where we had ala carte breakfast at the Rock Royalty lounge. The food spread and service were really good.
We especially liked the huge swimming pool, where the temperature was just nice. There were 2 lifeguards, and we saw one of them who sprung to action when one girl was struggling after falling from the 'walk on water' boards. So amazing and so alert!
The Shack Bar at the pool was another place we liked - they had happy hours during the late afternoons too.
We enjoyed the Pool Party on Saturday night - nice music from the live band and the nice foam! It was not noisy and it was really great music!
The location of Hard Rock was just nice - we could get on board a songthaew right at the door step! We could walk to Central, Terminal 21 and even to the Bali Hai pier if we did not wish to ride on the songthaew.
On the few times where it rained, we appreciated the umbrellas placed in our rooms and it was a nice touch!
There were so many nice restaurants nearby - eating indoors or outdoors, Thai food etc. It was amazing!
After eating all the food, we used the gym everyday and it was really nice, overlooking the pool.
When we return to Pattaya for our next holiday, we will stay in Hard Rock Pattaya again as we have had such an enjoyable time.",LL721,Date of stay: June 2019,5,Kuala Lumpur,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,5-Location,5-Cleanliness,5-Service,null,null,null,,

Ended up in one of the suites which was great valve for money. The room was massive, only down side did not look out onto the pool, but could see the sea, Pattaya South & Buddah hill.
Check in was very quick & we just left our luggage as we were checking in before 12:00. Access card was handed to us & the luggage would be taken to the room later.
Around 3;30 got back to hotel & straight in the pool with the daughter, they have lots of activities going on throughout the day to keeps the children occupied. Breakfast was served on the 9th floor in quite room, great for just relaxing & the breakfast was cooked to order so no noisy tourists or long queues. 
The staff are all very friendly, and they know how to keep children entertained. MY only slight complaint was after breakfast coming down to the pool around 9;30 and all the chairs in the shade were already taken, & by that I mean had towels on them no persons sitting. For the next 3 hours we were in the pool which offers very little shade most of the chairs were still not occupied. Whilst talking to the staff around the poolside bar they then told me that the beach huts are for rental approx. 1000Baht per day, but you do get free cocktail so works out not to be that expensive. For me though it’s frustrating when all the chairs in the shade are taken before 9:30 and not used.
My daughter is just at the age where she is too big to sleep with us, but an extra bed in the room makes it small, hire a suite, the living room is huge & the sofa makes a great bed so she can have her own space & not disturb us. The suite is well worth the extra month.",LukChang,Date of stay: July 2016,5,"Bangkok, Thailand",Trip type: Traveled with family,5-Rooms,5-Service,4-Sleep Quality,null,null,null,,

I was naturally looking for a similar experience. And I was disappointed.
The moment we got off the minibus from a 2 hours journey from Bangkok, you would expect a friendly staff smiling or greeting us at arrival. Nope. 
The check-in process was more business-like. The room was nice and clean.
The facilities were atypical of HRH, sandy swimming pool, full of activities to do thru-out the day, lots of music memorabilia on display and screens showing classic MTVs and concerts. 
But something was missing. The funk wasn't there. The Thais are supposed to be among the friendliest folks but they dun feel too happy here. There's no joyful banter, no playful chats and no random smiles as they walk past you. If it wasn't for Kart of the breakfast staff who was really fore-coming and Ann who was so friendly sending us off, I would have rated the stay much lesser. And I couldn't believe the hotel billed us for 2 towels that we returned late at night.

With a new baby in tow, this time we thought of the Hard Rock and came away with the feeling that the resort has much more potential to excel.
Pros: 
1. Huge pool. The massive pool is such a strong draw that one is almost willing to forgive any other shortcoming in the property itself. The shallow sands at one end and the kids pool at the other are a sheer delight for all ages
2. Service Staff. The service staff are mostly a fun bunch. They seem to enjoy their work a lot and are mostly a smiling bunch of well mannered folks.The guard at the pool exit onto beach resort was a super friendly person who kept helping us with our baby pram all the time.
3. The Ambience. Relaxing with a very cool and modern vibe. This is not a new hotel but they've constantly updated the property.
4. The Saturday Foam Party. We were so excited about the party that we delayed our departure by a day.
Cons:
1. Some of the SeaView rooms are really No View at all. There is a construction sight and most of the sea facing rooms overlook that side. Be careful while booking.
2. The number of Balcony rooms is very less. We initially got a Sea view room that had no balcony and overlooked the construction site. Upon our request they put us on the 2nd floor (Smoking Floor) with a nice balcony that overlooked the pool more than the sea. That was ok for us.
3. The rooms need to have a proper closet and not a nook with hangars. Come on, Hard rock. At least put shelves on the walls and cover the nook with a curtain.
4. The food. I've been a regular visitor to almost all the Beach road hotels and by far, the Hard Rock comes last on the taste and value for money count. Small portions, which are low on taste didn't make me happy at all. You guys really need to give some strong feedback to your Indian chef. The Tikka masala was nowhere close to the real deal and the Papad was hardly roasted. Yes, I'm nitpicking, but feedback is feedback.
All in all, I was a bit confused about my stay. I did enjoy some parts of it, but some other aspects of the stay weren't that great as well. I think this place has potential to hit the Pattaya Top 5, but management needs to make greater efforts.",premjit_pc,Date of stay: June 2015,3,"kolkata, india",Trip type: Traveled with family,3-Value,3-Rooms,4-Service,null,null,null,,

Small room was given, i was jusr a walk-in as my friends birthday in Pattaya was to be celebrated. This revamped 25 or 35 year old hotel has had a major renovation, before the HRC grop took it over. Amenities and accessoires are plenty, but the structure is of 60's or 70's charme. Other friends stayed for hal the rate in larger and better rooms at cozy hotels nearby, the only thing they were lacking was the music memorabilia, which decorates the whole area within the HRH. Elevator noise kept me up half the night, a request for room change was ignored.
Gratitude in the adjoining hard rock restaurant was included as per bill, but the staff requested a tip-in-hand on top. reception reminded of the good old days, when customers were treated well, but any off-standard requests were completely ignored. The HRC group clearly constructed a profit center here, where they took over a hotel past its shelf-life and souped it up with colored outdoor lights ans some memorabilia. At half or a third of the requested price, I wouldn't have raised my voice, but this city full of hotelrooms offers better rooms, better service at fractions of their prices. My planned week-long stay was cut short then and i moved out to a better place, saved a lot of money by doing so.

1. The rooms are smallish, and dorm like.  Although there is a balcony, the plastic white chairs on the balcony are unpleasant, and there is very little privacy since there is no shade, trees, etc. to block a guest who is on the balcony.  
2. The bathrooms are made of concrete, small and very no frills.  The very sunken bathtub is dangerous and hard to get in and out of.  My husband (who is 6 feet) actually tripped and hurt his foot while stepping out of the tub.  The design of the bathtub is also quite stupid since the only distinct feature is its deepness - its very narrow and unattractive overall (vivid blue color).   
3. Buffet is ok, nothing spectacular.  
4. Pool is ok, but surprised that there was NO landscaping, no trees, no gardens, etc.  around the pool at all!

I was reluctant booking this hotel due to the bad reviews & the ongoing renovation but was positively surprised.
The entire crew really lives up to the values of Hard Rock, giving 110% & putting the customer first. I really felt trusted, cared for and pleased. To measure the performance of the crew I must say they where extremely consistent and even some where visible driving forces. They believed in the product they where selling and was proud to be the faces of this international company. The crew did a great job. This is felt by the customer.
The rooms are small, even the newly renovated ones. You will trip over your luggage in the morning on your way to the bathroom, but they the bed is comfy and the rooms hold a high international standard including a high pressure shower.
The food - your can not go wrong - but some what pricy for Thailand.
The pool was clean with different possibilities.
The front desk Katya form Russia wanted to charge me 20 Bath for calling a taxi, some thing I find truly horrific after the amount I spend during my stay. 
Speaking of Russian, I wish the hotel could do more to accommodate Russian travelers as Russians are considered the most respected travelers world wide.
Here are some tips.
*Have a huge Hard Rock in Russian in the building.
*Russian language first on all menus with Thai & English as sub languages.
*More Russian vodka in rooms.
*Entire floors reserved for Russian travelers.
*Reserved parts of restaurants for Russian travelers so not to wait in line for a table.
*10 or more Russians TV channels
*More Russian speaking Thai's
*Russian food on the menu.
*Free Wifi for Russians
Anyway The Hard Rock is a cool place and we will be back but then we will book a suite and not standard rooms.

Security of the hotel is good! Guards at the lifts and at the beach entrance. Felt totally safe even though Pattaya beach was just across the street. 
Had lunch at Hard Rock Cafe. Food was great, but it was the service and hospitality that amazed us all. 
We were new in Pattaya and we were given some tips by one of the staff there (pity I forgot his name). Tall dude with dreadlocks, funky and friendly. You won't miss him.
We were happy with our room (upgraded from drluxe city view to deluxe sea view cause my friend had the ""hard rock all access card"") however, the toilet door was spoilt and toilet wasn't very clean. Probably that's why they were undergoing some renovation in the hotel. There were drilling sounds certain hours of the day (late morning till early evening). They have an edm on that information sent out together with the confirmation.
Did parasailing at Pattaya beach for 500bht each. We were brought to a platform in the middle of the sea by really bumpy speedboat and parasailed for about 3-5 mins. Was really exhilarating and we felt totally safe (you should have seen the number of straps they had on us).
The next day, we had a prearranged transport that didn't show up. A lady, I think was the duty manager helped us to call and clarify with the company. In the end they managed to arrange another taxi to bring us to Bangkok for part 2 of our trip. 
Great experience and we will definitely come back to Hard Rock Pattaya, maybe after the renovation is over.",Denisekoh,Date of stay: May 2011,4,"Singapore, Singapore",null,4-Value,3-Rooms,4-Location,3-Cleanliness,5-Service,null,,

Location of the hotel was excellent and staff were professional and welcoming. There is an exit that goes straight onto Beach Road and it is just a few minutes walk to Central Festival Shopping Mall.
We ate in Starz restaurant twice and the food was excellent. On the last evening we tried out the Hard Rock Café, again good food but the drinks are absurdly expensive. Rooms were clean and had a very nice décor and Rock theme. Some negatives however:
- Our ""Sea View"" room was only a partial sea view room. The hotel is not parallel with the sea (more like 45 degrees) so in our room you can only see the sea if you are right at the window.

- The television. Really poor reception quality.
- Breakfast. This was also in Starz but the quality and quantity of the buffet was not good. Western selection was very limited as were the Thai selection.
- Hard Rock Spa. We booked a foot massage for two. The service and the quality of the massage was great.

You need them especially when you are with 2 young kids. I believe that the hotel has one of the largest pool, great landscape. Very very friendly staff and reception. The restaurant was great and served good American Breakfast!
The Only disappointment, was the size of the room and bathroom. It was tiny sized room when compared to the price we had to pay for it. The bathrooms were even smaller and literally I had to make efforts to get in or come out (being a little bigger in size).
If you are resort lover, then this hotel is not for you. However the location is great and you may relate to your youth when you see all accessories related to rock music and those exotic guitars were simply amazing. You kind start relive those moments of childhood, if you are a rock lover. It so beautifully done as if the entire property is paying homage to the legends of the rock music.

Quito works around the pool and he gets people involved in the many games going on, initially my 8 year old son was apprehensive to get involved but he soon made sure we were made to feel very welcome. A little competitiveness is encouraged but it's not over the top and very friendly. After that he would remember your name and come over to say hello.
One slightly bad experience was not being allowed into the Hard Rock cafe because I wasn't wearing shoes. I think this is the first time in my life I've walked anywhere without shoes (we walked straight there from the pool). To be refused entry into the restaurant for the hotel you are staying at, when it is right next to a pool was just ridiculous.

2.

I can not recommend this hotel highly enough.
From the moment you step foot into this hotel, there is an abundance of staff only too eager to greet you and assist you.  I have found that the staff have remembered me which only makes my stay more enjoyable.  The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable.  The Buffet Breakfast is a great start to the day.  There is a huge variety of foods to choose from and all cultures would be satisfied with what is on offer.
The pool is huge, refreshing and clean.  Once again, there is an abundance of staff to help you with any minor detail or help assist you with any hotel activities.
The location of the hotel is ideal.  It is situated on Beach Road and the glitz and glamour of Pattaya is only a short walk or Baht Bus ride away.

Outstanding location, great value. Cold lemon grass welcome drink is worth mentioning. Very refreshing in hot and humid Thailand. But AC at lobby could seriously need an overhaul! 
Service
English speaking staff, good security. Bill was carefully explained to me and compliantly laundry services.
Location
Outstanding! 1.5hr by car from airport, 1hr to Amata City/Eastern seaboard industrial park. Lots of food, shopping etc 10THB away by pickup Tuk Tuk from HRH. I would definitely stay at Pattaya the next time I need to visit customers in these 2 industrial parks. 
Room
Comfortable bed. Noise is not a problem for me as i stay on the 5th (non smoking) floor with balcony facing the sea. In fact, there was a private foam party just beside the pool. No significant noise during that. 
Cleanliness was up to standard. Only complain was the Wifi is not working very well for me and the hot shower takes some time to heat up. 
Food
Good spread of choices for breakfast although there is only a slight change in the selections. If you are staying here for more than 3 days, breakfast might turn boring. But again, you can always go out for other cuisine. 
Dinner buffet (same place as breakfast) serves up a hearty selection. But i wouldn't mind a bigger selection of grilled seafood. 
The location makes it very easy to eat at other restaurants. There is a Japanese place, 10mins walk (turn left from hard rock cafe) frequent by Japanese working in Thailand. Food and service are both excellent. Bill came in about 4000THB for 6 pax. 
Rean Thai restaurant (opposite Marriott) is also 10mins by tuk tuk and it serves up very a appetizing Tom Yam soup, tender pandan chicken wraps etc. Live Thai dance show was ongoing throughout the dinner. Warning!!! No AC at this place so dress lightly and bring your own mozzie repellant.

When one compares the price of a night at the Hard Rock with say the Royal Cliff, its hard to comprehend that they are charging the same rate per night as they are simply not in the same league.

The original room I was given was not suitable and the only other room ready at that time was on a smoking floor which was not ideal. The room itself did not suffer from a smell of smoke but the smell in the corridors was a mixture of damp carpets and smoke. It really was a terrible smell There were even ashtrays outside the lifts - smoking in rooms is ok but I don't think it should be allowed in the corridors. The room itself was fine for the money paid.
I have to say that staff on check-in and check-out were friendly and there was always a friendly welcome when walking through the reception area. The pool area looked really nice but I didn't get a chance to use it unfortunately.

Since we don't have a lot of time, I booked and paid for a Producer Suite, supposedly one of the best (and the expensive room) with butler service. I booked this suite, expecting better service and good space.  While the room is very big, but the service is not as expected. 
This suite came with 2 free cartoon network water park tickets, so I booked for another 2 tickets for my kids and also the transportation for 4 to the waterpark.  I confirmed twice in the email and then paid extra for the tickets and confirmed again during check-in.  The next morning, cartoon network said that we have only 2 bookings for the transportation. After lots of confirmation, we finally got on to the bus.  Not over yet, when we arrived the water park, they said we don't have a coupon, so we are declined to enter.  I paid everything at the hotel and I was told twice that when I arrived I'll be allowed to get it.  Anyway, this tells a lot about their coordinating ability.   Wasted a lot of time to do coordination myself. 
I was expecting personalized service by paying extra for a nice suite, on the contrary, I ended up doing lots of those things myself.

Room is not actually spacious, bathroom reasonably sized though, but for me shower head n washing basin water pressure is a little too weak. No toilet bidget. No toothbrush n room slippers provided unless u ask for them.
Daily room cleaning not consistent, as in one day it looks well cleaned, second day our shoes n slippers n clothes were left exactly where we left them in the middle of the room without being moved at all, another day they forgot about the towels n we had to call for them after showering.
Bed was comfortable, but the 2 pillows provided was either too hard n high, or the other one too low n flat. Asked for another type of pillow but reception said they only have 2 kinds. 
Spa was expensive n not up to basic massage standard at all. Price not really a big issue but as someone who frequents spa 3 times a month, this spa is not up to standard.
Good points! 
- Perfectly located. Walking distance to almost everything u need from food to entertainment.
- Big n comfortable pool. They have a Foam Party every Saturday night, in-house guests only have to pay 200baht to join the fun. Well worthy. 
- Good varieties of choices for daily Breakfast buffet.
- Was SO relieved that their Soul Lounge was the ONLY privileged place which is allowed to serve alcohol during the 2 days of Buddhist Festival!!! Can't imagine a holiday without some Thai beer...

The room was huge and there was plenty of room for all of us.

The other room was just a deluxe room (too many of us to fit into 1 room) and that was also spacious and tidy.
The staff was AMAZING and they were so wonderful with the kids. We spent the afternoon in the pool and the older kids loved the basketball and volleyball games going on in the big pool. We also hired a cabana for the afternoon for only 500 Baht, this included 2 beers, 2 cokes and 2 waters in the little bar fridge. It was nice to be able to relax in the shade as it was hot.

It would have been nice if this upgrade was just offered in the first instance rather than ask us to be inconvenienced. The room was lovely, spacious, clean with many little touches.
You get 4 items of laundry done free as well as the lounge access which includes soft drinks, tea, coffee and small snacks all day long. Just what was needed to recover from the flight!
In the evening they moved their happy hour downstairs to one of their bars. They offered a lovely menu of drinks including cocktails for 1.5 hours and were readily offering more drinks. The food provided was lovely and it actually wasn't worth going for dinner afterwards!
The hotel has a lovely atmosphere. Breakfast can be taken in the lounge on an a la Carte basis or from the hotel restaurant. This was quiet before 8am but after this gets very busy and loud with many Chinese guests. The food choices were really good and also nice quality.

Stayed in room 1032 which was a Club sea view room. The room was a great size and view over the bay towards the Pattaya City sign. 
I recommend you utilising the Club level of room as it affords you the use of the Club lounge. Snacks all day including Coffee, pastries, sandwiches and soft drinks. Also cocktail hour from 6 till 7.30. With a lovely variety of cocktail food and cheeses. 
The pool area is second to none. You can hire a cabana for the day for 1000 Bht or use one of the many lounges around the pool. 
Staff at this Hotel are very customer oriented and always give you a pleasant sawadee krap when you pass. 
I have to mention the Staff in the Starz restaurant as I had breakfast (included in the room rate) each morning there. They were really great and by the second day were all greeting me by name. A very nice touch.

We are a family of 4 with 2 kids aged 9 and 11. This is by far one of the most fun hotels I have ever stayed in. My family was in tears when we left as staff came to say goodbye to us. We hardly leave the hotel when we stay here as the activities all day by the pool are so much fun. Dont get me wrong the place isnt perfect and like anything you could pick holes here and there but on the whole we love this hotel. 
The pool is a great size and the pool staff are the friendliest I have ever met. They really seem to enjoy their job. Please say hi Arm if you have the chance. Great guy. He really took care of us, again. The activities are varied and spaced well, dont forget the kids foam party on Saturday. I recommend renting one of the private cabanas facing the pool for 500B if you plan to spend the day at the pool. You get some drinks included so it practically pays for itself. You can win free drinks by winning the pool games which is fun. We won 2-4 a day while we were there! 
My biggest complaint is the lack of a Happy Hour for drinks around the pool which is pretty stupid if you ask me. Every other hotel we have stayed in at Pattaya have a happy hour. I was told they will be starting that system in september. 120B plus 17% service charge for a beer is just silly. You can go out the front gate on beach road and just on the left have a beer for 40B.
We stayed in a family suite which is excellent. Two bedrooms, living room, two bathrooms and two balconies. Modern furnishings, comfortable beds, big bathrooms. The gym is nice and breakfast buffet offers a good selection. 
We met a lot of people that were returning for another visit and I think that speaks for itself. We will be back again, hopefully next August. Its not a cheap option but worth every penny.

The room was adequate, if not a little dated and the huge oversized sofa was surprisingly uncomfortable. The bathroom was enormous, but the shower was VERY tiny. Impossible to turn around without bumping into the fixtures! Also, we paid for a ""seaview"" but it was only possible to view the sea by leaning over the railing to look right. 
Further, they're taking the ""covid precautions"" to the extreme, even though Thailand has had no new local cases in more than 2 months. They've installed thick plexiglass at the check in counter, so it was impossible to hear staff without leaning over to listen though the space at the bottom. The rock royalty lounge is closed, even though other similarly priced hotels in the area have theirs open. The soul lounge downstairs and the Hard rock cafe on Beach Road are also completely shut down. Also, no happy hour at the pool and not many shaded areas to lounge in. 
Speaking of the pool, it was impossible to relax by the pool as their were kids' activities going on at the pool all afternoon with a staff member squawking into a poolside loudspeaker at the small same group of children encouraging them to run the same races over and over again. So if you ""energetic"" noisy children, then this is definitely the place for you! If you are a couple trying to enjoy a beach getaway...not so much!
Lastly, breakfast was underwhelming, and it seems like they may be cutting costs by skimping on food quality.

I can't say enough great things about this hotel. Perfect location right next to the beach ( only a road block away). We mostly spent our 3 days around the pool. I travel with young children and this hotel feel like we are in our own world. My kids love the pool. 
Pro:
--  cleanliness. I just can't believe this hotel has been opening for decades but it's still look modern and super clean inside
-- staff at the front desk JJ (aka Madonna) upgraded us to city view and he was super nice and friendly yet professional.
-- buffet breakfast oh my. Too much to choose from and all tasty with English and Asian style! 
-- pool was our highlight. It was huge and nice design. The staff here were spontaneous and helpful. They were so easy going and I felt like we stayed at all-inclusive hotel in Mexico. They did a great job. They deserve the raise for sure!!!
--- Room were clean and spacious with 2 twin size beds. Shower was modern and functional. Really beautiful
Con:
- In my opinion the price for the food and beverage are a lil high. I would suggest if they do happy hour and weekday special. They would catch more of the guests. 7/11 is only 5 mins walk which is lot lot cheaper. Why not spend less right? 
- all the activities here are not fee. Although the tube ( 300 per day) or kid room for kid to play ping pong (250 baht per kid) They try to charge with everything. I understand but I think it is too much. 
Other than this I think this hotel is one of my fav hotel.

The rooms are OK, if not slightly small, but are clean and modern. The cable TV is good with the usual selections of movie channels together with MTV's own music channels. The pool complex is excellant with a seperate shallow lagoon area that the kids can plan in, the hard rock staff also run games and play music all day which keeps everyone amused. Once a week there is a foam party which goes on till late but at other times the music isnt excessive.
The main restaurant is obviously the hard rock cafe but for lunch the best place is the cafe near the pool which offers excellant thai food as well as western stuff as well.
The best thing about this place is the staff who were really laid back but also genuinely helpful and they seemed to enjoy what they do which always makes a difference.

If ur planning to stay with kids then this is the perfect choice. Location is just right not too far from all the attractions and not too close to the walking street. Everything is walking distance and there is a convenience store right outside the rear side entry gate.
About the hotel, what makes this hotel stand out is the staff. Each and every member goes out of their way to make ur stay special. Special word of recognition for Ms. Natsya at the front desk who helped me get an early check in after an overnight journey. She even helped us change the room next day to give us our preferred room. Also to point out that she was extremely patient sincere and very courteous.
Another mention would be Ms Paew at the tour desk who arranged pick up services for us for tiger Park even when we decided to choose and buy the packages from tiger Park instead. Unlike other hotel tour desks. Also I would like to mention contrary to the usual hotels I found much better deals when booking through them. This is the kind of service that makes u want to write a review in the middle of ur stay. EXCEPTIONAL.
ROOM TIP : If ur big on the room space then opt for a room without balcony.
And if u don't mind a smaller room area then go for the rooms with a balcony. Either way rooms are the same. If u opt for a corner room then you would get somewhat an L shaped room which gives u a window as well as a small balcony.
Just a word of advice for the housekeeping department. They should keep a record of no. of guests per room.

The room was modern and clean.  I did have a problem with no water from the hot taps one morning and then when it came through it was a very dirty brown colour. Also there was a problem with my shower.  However having reported this I was then inundated with people wanting to make sure I was OK and everything was sorted – so much so that it was difficult to get ready later that afternoon.  The hairdryer in the room was good and there was a good supply of teas, coffee & bottled water daily.  Robe & slippers were provided.  I had a small balcony with sea views.
I had breakfast in the main buffet dining room rather than the Club lounge which had the normal selections you would expect at this level of hotel.  
The hotel is exactly what you would expect of something carrying the Hard Rock brand.  Energetic, lively, good music, young and interesting music memorabilia surrounds you.   
Pattaya is very busy and Hard Rock is centrally located near all the activity.  I have never seen so many water sports and sun loungers in one place as there was on the beach just across the road from the hotel.

The breakfast buffet is a must, especially if you have a more Western appetite. The breakfast buffet also has Eastern dishes and changes daily (Singapore noodles, beef soups, etc).
The pool is expansive and large. There can be a lot of kids during the day but it's quite peaceful at night.
The massage service is so-so.
The ""break room"" where they have ping-pong tables and video games... you have to pay extra money for that.
The other restaurants at the hotel are great. You can even request specific Thai dishes if you want. They will make it for you as well. 
Sometimes they have live music with slow jazz near the outside lobby, near the pool area. It is quite nice.
The foam party is fun. It is in an area away from the pool, so you won't be in water while experiencing the foam. The floor is just cement. But they had a live DJ with dancing go-go girls.
The hotel is right next to their Hard Rock Cafe, which you can room charge and get discounts. Food is great there and probably the best restaurant in that area for Western cuisine. Even if you walk down the road, Hard Rock Cafe was the best.
As for the rooms, the bathroom is a sliding door (so you will have privacy) but the shower is an open concept, so the ENTIRE bathroom WILL steam up and get soaked in humidity. Beware of that.
Also, the room (the one we got) smelled like sweat (perhaps the carpet from puke or something). Make sure you smell your room, and change if you do not like. But overall, the design of the room was good and you are better off here than some local/rundown Thai motel/hotel.
Their room service food was great. But sometimes they run out of items on the menu so beware.
Getting an ocean or pool view room is better than getting the city view. The location in the front of the hotel (which faces the city) is not good. The ocean/pool view faces the main road and is the ""back"" of the hotel.
If you are on your honeymoon, they do not provide good service. Just some some glass of juice and chocolate strawberries, which were not fresh.
Overall, come here for convenience of breakfast, food, pool, and some fun. Prices overall provide good value for what you get.
P.S. You can find an actually better deal on their main website for Hard Rock with special discounting if you book directly than going to those other 3rd party travel sites.

Everybody in the hotel is very friendly and helpful -- The rooms are small yet cosy - we stayed very comfortably in a deluxe sea view (new) room. Awesome view of the beach front.
The part which i loved the most was the Beach Foam Party - which got over too soon :( 
The pool bar and all the band members at the bar were very cool (i got a free shot! :) )

Location
The hotel is at a very central location from both entrances (front and back- beach road and central road) And has the Blue Baht bus outside each entrance which is very useful. Other than that it leaves a lot to be desired!
Let's begin with the rooms- 
Stained carpets and frayed upholstery.
Dust visible on a lot of surfaces(even after 2nd day housekeeping)
Housekeeping is clearly not good. We have a stained glass in our room with coke and food! (Picture attached)
We specifically asked for the bed linen to be changed but it was not (Picture attached)
The very very flimsy room slipper (Just 2 pieces of paper attached together) broke and we put it in the trash- it was not replaced.
Cushions not put back in place .
Towels have seen better days.
The flush has been leaking and making water dripping noises.
The bathroom is really really dark... So if you are planning to do any makeup or grooming, that will be challenging.
POOL
Very large, lots of activities for kids and rock pool etc. Very nice. Lots of sun beds with and without umbrellas. Fun pool.
They picture 8 floats and flat beds on their website but these are charged for use! 
Also the pool parties and foam parties that you see on the website are only on a Saturday.
The Room has so many things that you can buy, everything has a tag! Honestly for me that is a put off! Just don't place those items in the room as the store is below and can be visited by any patron who wish so! It gives you a very uncomfortable feeling that you don't know what you might get charged for!
The restaurant food is just average (which in itself is shocking for any eatery in Thailand as the food here is always amazing) and highly priced. You can just walk out of the hotel and find restaurant after restaurant in all cuisines.

Afterwards, tried their hamburger which is huge. I'd give it an average to good rating in terms of taste. Apart from those, we didn't really spend a lot of time in the hotel as we were always out. If you plan to go around Pattaya coming from Hard Rock, it is much more convenient to travel with a hired cab/van (which we did for 2 days) already. The beach is situated just behind the hotel but the other areas (Walking Street, etc.) require riding a tuk-tuk.

The pool area was awesome, from young kids to older ones with free activities around the pool side. The pool itself was beach themed and had plenty of beds. The beach was easily accessed from it and walking through Pattaya itself I wouldn't venture out much as it was horrid. 
For supper there was two options...buffet at an extortionate rate at £22 per head or the usual HRC menu. 
We've just finished breakfast and I think we're all stuffed. 3 themes of food were Asian, Western and American. Everything was freshly prepared and plentiful. The servers were very efficient. Everytime a plate or bowl was finished the table was cleared within seconds.

The rooms are full various stains and extremely outdated.(especially the bathrooms)
You can hear the loud conversation of the cleaning staff at the hallway when they begin their routine check on the rooms at 07:30.
The daily in room internet charge of 600 baht is unacceptable if you consider the condition of the rooms.
The food at the main restaurant (buffet) is below average and overpriced.  I had the pleasure of collecting hair from my chicken dish. In return, the management was kind enough to make 10% discount on the drinks. 
The service that I received during check-out topped it all.  I had noticed that there was a internet charge of 1200 baht for one of the days I stayed in.  I pointed out this mistake (which could have been my fault also since you might choose the daily package twice!!). Extremely unfriendly, Mr. Paopong refused to listen to me and pointed out that if it was a mistake, it would not be on my bill. He was kind to ask me why this charge was on my bill??!!  I doubt any of the staff at the reception had any training in their fields or they hate to work there.
If you find yourself staying at this establisment, do not be too kind to tip the waiters since the hotel bills  you with 10% service charge on everything you eat and drink.
Finally, if you are single and got lucky one night, expect to pay 900 Baht to accompany your lady to your room :) this earns the hotel the brothel status and extremely insulting to the lady.
Overall, I strongly reccomend you to avoid this hotel.  The only positive thing that I can write is the fact that the location and the friendly staff at the pool area of the hotel.

Then there is the bathroom lighting, very sexy, so long as you don’t want to put on makeup or have a shave, the apparent lack of extractor fans only compounds the problem when mirrors fog up. Then let’s not forget the toilet anyone over 90kg just won’t fit. All in all not a pleasant experience.

But at the end I enjoyed the stay there.
It's a huge area with a big Swimmingpool, nice gym and spa. The restaurants Are also very good and it's really quite but you still are at the beach road soi 7!
The rooms are nice, the view of the city view room could be a bit better but maybe depends in which floor you are staying.
Only thing what was annoying was that there are a lot of security at night there.
May this is there way to make people feel more secure but it's a bit of an overkill!

Firstly, i arrived to the hotel after 6 hours ride from Malaysia to Bangkok and to Pattaya. Before check in the take two cups of cocktail for me & my fiance. After check in, we went in the room and we're loving it. Well designed, comfortable & multi featured tv. Right after taking shower, we went down to the lobby to enquire some questions about the places to visit from the receptionist. They are very helpful, besides providing the informations and make reservation for us, they also arrange transportation for us to go around the places we want to visit. Each and everytime i walk in and out the lobby, if i have anything carrying on my hand, they sure will offer to help me take it.
Later in the evening, we had our dinner in the Hard Rock Cafe and i can say that the food was excellent! Each guest/table will have their own Server/Waiter and the one served us was providing very good service. Each food then we're eating, he will ask how's the taste? do we like it?
The next day i went to the Rock Spa in the hotel. Although it was just an hour spa but i fell very relaxing. Me & my fiance went to the Hard Rock shop below the Hard Rock Cafe to buy some of the Hard Rock t-shirts too. Some of the reviews complaining the lights in the balcony very ugly. The lights are part of the Hotel design. I personally don't feel that its disturbing or making me feel uncomfortable.

 we never ate here so cant comment there. grabbed lunch at Central Festival (mall) everyday and is a 7 minute walk or jump on the baht bus if its too hot or raining for 10 baht. they also furnish two umbrellas in the closet which is good for rain or sun. we opted for the ocean view, good idea about 25 to 30$ more.

The hotel has everything to offer. As you enter the hotel you can feel the liveliness of Hard Rock. The staff at the Reception and elsewhere is friendly and welcoming. The lobby is quite like a disco cafe. 
The rooms are big with super nice decor inspired by the Hard Rock culture. My personal favourite in the room was the music system playing nice retro music. 
the view from my room was also nice. 
The bathroom are done in black finish that eventually became my second favourite.
The hotel has a super big summing pool with two sections. One for adults and one for slides and kids that has sand at the bottom that gives you a feel of being at a beach. The Spa facility at the hotel is more than I expected. You have Sauna, Spa, big Shower area, indoor pool, steam and much more. 
Talking about the pricing, I feel that the kind of facilities the hotel is proving against what its charging, is really nothing.
The breakfast at the hotel is also grand. 
In all, the hotel is by far my best stay in Pattaya. And I recommend my 50000+ readers to choose this hotel over any other hotel in Pattaya.",Saras Singh,Date of stay: May 2018,5,"Abu Road, India",Trip type: Traveled with friends,5-Cleanliness,5-Service,5-Sleep Quality,null,null,null,,

There are three problem in the room which is the scupper when u come out of the toilet, if you dont take notice of it, you gonna knock your toes onto it and that happens twice two my gf. The hot water was horrible. When we turn it on, the water flows more a few seconds cold and burning hot(burning your skin) alternatve until you completely using the shower.Finally, the toilet bowl and basin wasnt clean when we checkin. If Hard rock hotel could focus on the following, i would say its thumb up. The receptionist , security guard and all are polite. Check-in and checkout was fast and efficient.
Live band & Restaurant: Food prices are reasonable and the ambience is nice. The bands is good. Unfortunately when the lady singer sang, her voice was drown by the pianon and guitar playing. Hence on and off you can hear her sing which she has a good voice.
Foam party: Foam Party was good and lots of fun.
Breakfast: Breakfast was good with lots of varieties. Really enjoying it. The downside is that the waiter/waitress was not fast enough to clear the table.

I have been going to Pattaya since the 90's when there was nothing much in Pattaya and now when it is thickly populated, there is a huge choice of Hotels. Amongst them all I recommend Hard Rock because of various reasons. This Hotel is strategically located, main entrance is from the 2nd road and back entrance is from the beach road. You step out from beach road and the bus stop is right there. You can get Baht buses from there or grab a cab if you wish. But everything is at a walking distance so walking is highly recommended. Central Festival is hardly half a km away, Central Marina is less than a km away, Mike shopping plaza is about 1.2 km away. Massage Centers are at every nook and corner. You can get speed boats from across the road.Inside the Hotel is a paradise for children and adults both. I was travelling with my husband and kids. There are so many activities through out the day that you would not even want to step out! Their pool is the best in Pattaya with a mini waterpark and slides as well. My children spent 4 hours on an average in the pool which is too much! But you can imagine that how great it would be for kids to stay in the pool for so long. Each member of Hard Rock staff is extremely courteous and friendly. You just feel at home over there. Its like a big huge family. I go there every year and each year number of days keep on increasing. Comfort at its best! Vacations are all about fun and comfort. And our vacation can never be complete without Hard Rock.

This hotel is definitely designed for families of all ages and as such it ticks all the boxes.
Rooms: these were average could have been a bit cleaner. Lack of wardrobe and drawers. Fine if your stay is a couple of nights, poor if your staying longer. Where they score is the tech in the room , so you get a dedicated music channel to choose from and a huge speaker system to plug your iPod etc in. The tv has a movie channel and a few other free channels to amuse yourself with . If you want current films then they are on a pay per view system. 
Breakfast: Amazing choice.. Something for all nationalities. 
The pool area is simply amazing. Cabanas to rent. One side is designed like a beach which winds into the swimming pool. Games such as water aerobics/ polo/ basketball. are arranged with the guests throughout the day. My kidz thoroughly enjoyed this.

also agree with someone else' review about the bathroom - no fan - and the step in and out was horrible - i almost fell a million times - and the shower screen is useless - the water goes all over the bathroom floor so we had to use our towels to dry the floors so we would not slip - bathrooms are terrible designed for safety - could not imagine having young children stay there for that reason
we also had to repeatedly buzz reception to ask for new towles ( we made 4 calls to reception in 2 hrs asking for new towels and explained that the bathroom floors where wet from the shower being poorly designed) and to collect our luggage - even though this was pre booked - our driver was waiting 45 mins - and we where charged extra by the driver- 
reception staff useless when it came to asking them about the hotel facilities
no info in our room
no menu for room service - we aksed several times and i even went down stiars to ask staff - but lack of english skill didnt help
we didnt like the fact that wifi was not provided free of charge - never has this issue at any other hotel i have stayed in thailand - and internet was very expensive to use
also - place was a bit pricey for thailand - i have stayed in bigger places with 4-8 swimming pools in thailand with many bars restaurants free wifi balcony and bigger rooms at hakf the price
with all negatives aside
loved the place it looked amazing
rennovations didnt bother us - we didnt hear much going on
loved the swimming pool area
very clean
pool bar was great
staff there were amazing - Jamie was very helpful and gave us alot of info about pattaya and hard rock cafe and so did the other staff
security were very nice smiles all the time
the hotel beds - some of the best sleep i have ever had!
ashame no balcony for us smokers
overall i give this a 7 out of 10
place needs better bathrooms
better reception staff

Having seen a discounted booking online for the Hard Rock with an ocean view, I gave it a shot.   Oh well.  Sometimes these things work out and sometimes they don't.
The room appeared clean.  The bed was comfortable. There was a  couch.  There was parking, but you had to walk 100 meters to your car.   I accept these things.
The 2 issues are foremost:
1.  Ocean view refers to keeping your face less than 0.5 meter from the glass at the distal most end of the room to the glass window and then forgiving the trees which occupy the bulk of the water presence, enjoy what limited observations one can make of the water from this location.
From the bed. No view.  The ocean is party visible through the trees only from the limited corner of the room.
2.   The smell of urine was strong in the toilet and the smell permeated into the room.
The property had its positives but this is not a property I would visit again.
I would add however that the staff training in English is far superior to the vast majority of Thai hotel properties I have encountered and give credit where it is due.  Nonetheless, the lack of proper view when one's only purpose in such visit was an ocean view is hard to recover from.   I also prefer not to smell urine in the room when possible.",B P,Date of stay: June 2013,3,Bangkok,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,3-Value,4-Rooms,4-Location,3-Cleanliness,4-Service,5-Sleep Quality,,

We go to hard rock cafè's when ever we can. But this was the first time we had stayed in one of the hotels and it was disappointing. Maybe our expectations where unrealistic but the hotel didnt come anywere near what we get in hard rock caffe's. I guess staff need to be trained they are far behind the staff in hard rock cafes , bartender and staff in the shack bar (pool bar)  avoid any eye contact and conversation , some example that won’t let me back to hard rock hotel again: as I mentioned staff (almost all) except housekeeper and carpark guys , which were very friendly and nice, kids club , breakfast , just wonder why dinner buffet is so good with great food and service and very friendly and attentive staff specially the grill chef , but breakfast buffet is exactly opposite? is it because breakfast is included or free ? breakfast is chaos.
 You did not need a room card to use the lifts, which is a serious security issue. There was not always a security guard at the lobby.
Bathroom need fan it was a fan vent but not sure it was really working , from the steam and smell I assumed  fan wasn’t working. My room number was 818 , and the rain drip shower and shower head working at the same time, even I tried to stop one by pressing the button but nope no chance also the hot water in the shower has a mind of its own so be very careful with children as they could get a nasty burn.

This was my first trip to Thailand so I really relied on reviews like this one to guide me in my hotel selection.  The room was clean, modern and the staff was very friendly.  I'm not the type of traveler that expects employees in foreign countries to speak perfect English so I wasn't put off when they couldn't.... I worked around it by letting them get someone that spoke English a little better...  I really didn't have that problem too often so wasn't really an issue.  

I included the breakfast and wireless internet... I was pretty happy with both.  I chose the lower price of the internet options available and was able to do everything I wanted.  Plus I could access it all over the hotel...except in the Hard Rock Cafe.   

This hotel is not very close to walking street which was OK by me because I wasn't very interesting in going there.

Have to say that they've done a really good job with a complete re-fresh, re-brand and re-launch.  Hotel is in a good location too, right on beach road, with but a 5 minute walk to Central Festival or 15mins down to Walking St and that part of town.  Always pleny of taxis running past if you're wanting to head to Jomtien or some other part of town!

On arrival, you get the impression you're stepping into some sort of VIP lounge with the dark mable and decor etc.  Whilst the english of the check in staff wasn't great it wasn't bad either, but check in was efficient and helpful.  Rooms are definately more contemporary looking now, and staying in a club room, was impressed with the amount of toiletries and products available in the bathroom.  Really comfortable bed too.  Only thing that stops me giving those hotel an excellent rating was the range of snacks and beverages at Happy Hour in the Club lounge, felt that this was really limited and disappointing.

Even the pool has had a refresh with new loungers and cushions etc. The hotel wasn't that busy during my time there, and whilst there are a reasonable amount of sun loungers, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a one during peak season.  The pool is one of the best features of the hotel, and one of the largest hotel pools I've seen in Thailand anywhere.  Great beach feature.

Main hotel restaurant offered a good quality and varied buffett in the evenings and the breakfast wasn't that bad either.

If you want to go somewhere in Pattaya for a few days and avoid the sleaze then this is place. The F&B is good and affordable. They have kids menu as well. The only downside that I notced just this last weekend is the huge number of tor groups they seem to have there. I haven't been for a few years and now the place seemed overrun with Korean and HK tour groups. Really noisy and many seem to be able to shout, eat and smoke at the same time. Actually the smoking issue is really something that management should take a look at because of the tour groups. They smoke pretty much everywhere in the outdoor areas where there are usually lots of children. I think mgt. should designate some non-smoking areas adjacent to the pool and in some of the outdoor eating areas. We stayed on the club floor which was OK because the downstairs breakfast area is like feed time at the zoo in the mornings.

The rooms are designed by a madman! The sink is pointing in the wrong direction, there is very little cupboard space and the small rooms leave you feeling dizzy because of their weird shape. 

The hotel has many rules, only some of which are enforced apparently based on your country if origin. Guests of a certain faith are allowed to use the pool fully clothed, guests from China can do whatever they want including bringing street food to the pool and consuming huge quantities of it. I take my 19 year old son to the Hard Rock Cafe and we are escorted off the premises by three members of staff at 1 minute to 10 as the rules say you need to be 20 years old to be in there after 10pm.

The hotel is just a bed and breakfast for unruly rude Chinese tour parties, breakfast is a scrum involving hundreds of people, for the rest of the day and night the hotel is deserted, might be a good idea to look at F & B prices to encourage a few guests to stay in, nearly £40 for an average buffet and £6 for a glass of beer.

I knew exactly what to get here. A stylish resort hotel. Friendly staff, lots of variety in bars restaurants etc.

The room was big and spacious and comfortable. The only issue was that the curtains seemed a a fraction too small, and allowed a little bit of light in.

I ate in the retaurant, the food was tasty. Nothing extravagant, but tasty.
The pool was lovely, lazed around it for 2 days. They should probably look at changing the sun lounger matresses to something water proof (so they can be dried) or alternatively store them under cover during rainy season, so that they can be taken out or pout away when the rain comes, It wasn't that nice lying on a damp sun lounger.

When I arrived there was a bit of a damp smell in teh corridor leading to my room, but they seem to have noticed that themselves, and it was gone by the time I was leaving.

My big problem with the hotel was the concierge - I felt he was trying to screw me and kept referring me to more expensive options of transport I was asking for. I asked him to book me a taxi to the bus station, but he informed me that 8 hours wasn't enough time to make it to the airport, and he could get me a minibus direct to the airport for 1500 baht. I used a direct public bus direct to bangkok for 100 baht!

The conciege should be an honest guy who can help provide direction and information, I felt this guy was just trying to refer me to expensive services he knew, maybe he was getting a refferall fee, I felt this let the hotel down, and showed it in a bad light.",brian82ie,Date of stay: June 2013,4,"Athlone, Ireland",Trip type: Traveled solo,4-Value,4-Rooms,4-Location,4-Cleanliness,3-Service,4-Sleep Quality,,

We used the kids club twice, once was the whole day and I was a little disappointed in the activities available for the kids.  Given the costs you pay for the kids club, I would have thought there would be a greater amount of crafts and activities being offered to the children. There is a strong preference for watching dvd's and playing playstation games rather than playing toys and doing crafts.  The pool area and the activities around the pool are great for kids of any age.  The sandy beach area is shallow enough for our 3 year to stand up and splash around.  There are mats and other pool equipment available for rent.  The water slide is also great for little kids but they will need assistance getting up the steps.  There are afternoon activities including games and the best was on the Saturday afternoon when there was a kids foam party as well as staffed dressed up as super heroes doing balloon crafts.

To begin with, before our trip, they took ages to reply our email queries. When they replied that asked us back if our package comes with complimentary entry to Cartoon Network Amazone Water Park when we asked if there is complimentary transport there. Obviously, the staff who replied doesn't do her homework to check the package we have booked (reservation no. was provided to them).

Upon arrival, the hotel didn't look to us that it is well maintained. It looks old and room floor passage way ceiling is low. This gives a suffocating feeling when walking at the room floor passage way.

At check in at the VIP conceige, we asked for a Non Smoking Sea View Lil Rock suite but we given a smoking room instead. When we asked the staff who escorted us to our room, he said ours is a Non smoking floor. We later found out at the lift,which indicates that Level 10 is a smoking floor. So, we feedback to Ann (the lady who manages the VIP conceige). She then apologized and explained why our request cannot be fulfilled. We accepted it.

On another occasion, we asked the night duty VIP Conceige staff (not Ann) about the opening hours of Lil Rock. She gave us wrong info.

Hard Rock Hotel Pattaya, may I request you to train your staff well to provide guest with right information of your hotel? This is extremely embarrassing for your entire hotel organization! If they are not sure, please tell guest that they will check and get back. Please do not give guests falseful info. No guests will like being skirt around! 

Room housekeeping. The housekeeping didn't come for turn down service on Day 1 and 2. Likewise, for usual morning room make up on Day 2. Again, we have to feedback to Ann. If the housekeeping miss our room the first time, we can understand...but thrice? 

X box in room. Lil Rock suite comes with X box in the room. Ours was out of order on Day 1. The repair man came twice separately on Day 1 and 2, so repaired twice but can't be played again after 15 mins so my boys eventually gave up playing it.

Waiting time for food order at restaurant. OMG....it is way too long. The waiting time is almost 30-45 mins and it is during their off peak hours. But strange, the room service for food is efficient regardless when you order.

On our 2nd last day there, we asked for kid's room slippers. They came and gave us adult's. When I told them that it is not right. The guy told me that they do not have spare pairs. We feel that this is fishy cos' how can a hotel that cater for families run out of kid's room slippers? We went to the VIP conceige and requested for it. And, we finally got our request. This, we feel that staff is plain laziness to get the request right. 

Hello, shouldn't Hard Rock do regular maintaince for their amenities and not give guests inconvenience to keep requesting and feedback umpteen times during their stay? What kind of a holiday is it when guests have to worry about such things?

Lil Rock. Nothing is exactly organized at the Lil Rock. Kids just go and play X box and toys. This is unlike other hotel kids' club that we have been to, which organized games and activities for the children. And, at Lil Rock, you have to pay for your kid to enter. Luckily, our package comes with complimentary 2 hours daily use so we didn't have to pay.

Both our toilets are smelly. I keep smelling urine on and off even though it has just been make up! And, they give adult tooth paste and brushes to children!

Complimentary Wifi.  The wifi is unstable and cumersome. Example, in room you may be logged out 2-3 times. As such, we have to log in several times a day in the hotel. To make things worst, this Hard Rock hotel issues password in a small piece of paper. So, guest will have to keep the paper. Else, you won't be able to use the wifi when you lose it or you will have to request again from the reception counter.

As for location, we feel it is not that accessible too. Central Festival Mall is about 15mins walking distance and the flea market is a distance too. The only convenience is to the beach which is just across the road.

Last but not least, when I asked for a cup of cuppocino at VIP Conceige. Your staff said ""OK. I will get it for you."" but didn't see my order served when I waited for 15 minutes. Your staff were talking merrily away among themselves when I was waiting. Eventually, I made my own cuppocino. What kind of hospitality is this?

Hard Rock Hotel Pattaya is definitely not worth the price we pay for this holiday! This is a hotel that does not pay attention details and guests' needs.

Mistake...... Although all facilities at the hotel are real nice, good rooms, good pool, actually most facilities are real good but in the hospitality business the most important factor is to make guests FEEL AT HOME and that is totally missing here. The bottom line is that they do not really care about hotel guests because if not you there will be someone else coming for the brand name and stay there. Plenty of potential visitors. They welcome the tourists that visit the hotel for a meal or drink, that's the goldmine.
It started with a 20 minutes wait for the luggage which arrived after 2 phone calls. 
Pool : as a hotelguest you have to pay extra to stay at the pool gazebo (ridiculous), the towels are a mile from the pool and there is no sign so you can pick them up before you go to the pool and the poolboy just says the towels are over there in a tone like 'go get them yourself'
Elevator : there was a guard  who was asking something in Thai and wouldn't let me in the lift at 11pm. A Thai couple helped me out and it appeared he wanted to see my room card. Isn't it possible that he would learn 1 single word englsih being ""room card' or a word close to it.... 
Breakfast : it is quite handy to put someone at the 'eggstation' who has no idea what a fried egg sunny side up is (sarcasm)

I have run large factories with 800+ employees all over Asia and i always taught my staff some very basic English or at least some important words. Taking into account that many. many hotel guests do not speak Thai, i find it an ommission of hotel management that not even 1 word of Englsih is spoken/understood even more surprising if one takes into account the percentage tourism represents in the GDP of Thailand. 
I heard from friends that the Hard Rock in Bali is a few classes better then the one in Pattaya, more hotel guests oriented  but for me once is enough since i am old fashioned, i like if an attempt is made to make me feel at home.",KeesSby,Date of stay: May 2014,3,"El Albir, Spain",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,3-Value,4-Rooms,4-Location,4-Cleanliness,1-Service,4-Sleep Quality,,

The hotel is fairly pricey for Thailand however if i was staying for a week or less I would probably book to stay here again.... If it's anytime over this you're looking at around £1500-£1700 for around 17 nights or so which can be a bit pricey -especially if you're travelling on your own.
The hotel is guest friendly - just ensure if you're on your own you book a double room and then leave any guest ID at the front desk....

On the other hand, check in was not as expected. Staff on the front desk was quite slow, and we had to bring our luggages and stuffs to our room ourselves (not too sure if this was they it is done here as she only sent us to the 9th floor lounge to get our key) which i expected for it to be kindly sent to our room just like other top hotel in the region. This is a small little thing, but surely will make guest happy.

Breakfast choice was limited on the 9th F as we only could order 1 main, but the other dessert, salad, and bread was in the buffet. (again, we expected a buffet for the mains).

Nevertheless we love our room on the 10th floor with sea view and a nice panoramic scene of Pattaya. Room was clean and amenities were complete. It has a king bed, sofa, desk, tv, and mini pantry. Bathroom amenities were lovable as well.

Location wise it was great on the main road, we could walked to several eateries like Mantra and Leng Kee. The beach is just a stone throw away. They had live music in the evening, so for those who love some drinks and nice music, look no further. Swimming pool was big with kids pool and basketball pool ring available.

Oh and we accidentally left our charger in the room, the staff (Miss Eve) kindly emailed me just now and i hope to get it sent to us soon. That was really helpful as well!

The composer suite comes with the lounge benefit such as daily refreshment, laundry, etc which worth the extra money.

Their high level of service and happy smiling faces were a pleasure to see.  The pools is one of the best and great if you have kids like us --- they have a huge separate beach pool(with real sand!) and water slides.  The service by the pools side was great too -- quick, attentive and always friendly.  Both my husband and I had massages done at the spa which was excellent -- they offer good deals with discounted prices which was great.  The therapists were professional and well trained in their field.  The hotel location is ideal to explore Pattaya -- lots of places to eat and shop.  We just had to cross the street from the hotels back exit to the busy, lively beach promenade.  A couple of nights we ordered in room dining and the quality of the food was exceptional -- and all served with a smile from the friendly Ryan from room service staff.  The buffet breakfast is always busy but the staff handle the crowd well so we never had to wait to be seated -- a bonus with 3 hungry kids!   There are a lot of asian items on the buffet along with made to order eggs, pancakes, waffles, cereals etc.  The only thing I would have liked to see was a better choice of fresh fruits that Thailand is renowned for. The rooms are spacious with comfy beds and were cleaned perfectly every day.  The downside was the small size of the bathrooms -- the shower area while spacious left little room for anything much else and the lack of having an exhaust led to a very steamy room.

Everyone has fun with the water games which are always well organized. Hard Rock staff, in particular DJ Sax, Quito, Khanchit, Boston and many….., are all very kind, helpful and super friendly.  If you like water games, team activities and social gathering with people from different countries, the main pool is definitely a must stay location during your stay in Hard Rock.  

Hard Rock Pattaya is one of the best I have ever been to.  It is the center of entertainment for everything, and somehow successfully target singles, families, children, and everything in between.

- The hotel environment is clean and quiet.
- The staff are friendly and always ready to serve.
- Breakfast at the Executive Lounge was marvelous.

- Location and scenery is definitely one of the best around that area.
- Security Officers are also doing a great job in keeping the hotel Safe & Sound.

But I found I was wrong finally.  I strongly recommend family with toddler DO NOT come here!  It is a disaster.
The shower there was a nightmare for kids.  They only provided rain shower head.  Parents would understand how terrible it was for kids.  I called the customer service and told them I preferred a room with “normal shower head with a hose” for my kids.  The answer I got was normal shower or bathtub was not available unless I paid a lot to upgrade to a big suite.  How ridiculous it was! I only wanted a bathroom with normal shower but not a super expensive suite.  The staff then said they could only send me a plastic baby bathtub, which was obviously not suitable for 2.5-yrs-old.  However, I did not have any option.  The staff talked to me over the phone was gross and threatening that they could not do anything more if we did not pay to upgrade.  I did not want to argue with them in front of my daughter.
When I received the bathtub, I was shocked that it was old and cheap.  The plastic was soft and thin.  I suspected if the plastic was safe to apply with hot water.  (I am alert to baby product and I only use branded baby product with certification.)  I was very disappointed with their service and the cheap tub they provided.  
Apart from above, the hotel was far from a 4 stars hotel.  The staff there was unhelpful and unfriendly.  I could never see a smile on their face.  
When we arrived the hotel at around 4pm, we were the only customer at check-in counter but it still spent us more than 20mins for check-in process.  After check-in, they gave us 3 glasses of welcome drinks.  I was carrying my asleep daughter and therefore I asked my hubby to take the drinks upstairs.  When we passed the check-in counter, a receptionist with red hair stopped us and said we were not allowed to take the drinks to the room.   She was rude when she spoke to us.  It seemed that we did something very wrong.  I told her politely that I could not drink it with my sleeping baby.  She did not give me any response and even did not look at my when I talked to her.  How considerate they were to ask a mum carrying a sleeping baby to enjoy their welcome drinks at the noisy lobby!  
We had reserved a Sea View Deluxe Room.  But 90% of the view was building and only 10% was sea view.  It was a cheat.  I stayed at 5/F but I could still heard the loudly music from the pool party until 1 a.m.  The water in the artificial beach was dirty.  I could see lots of branches, insect and rubbish in the water.  The restaurant was crowded.  There was little room between table and table.  I have emailed them dozens of times before my trip but I could never get any reply from them.  Overall, it is not a 4 stars hotel and it does not worth the price.  I am so regretful to stay there.  It definitely spoils a precious holiday I should have with my family.

I stayed there for 4 nights in May and had a great time inspite of some major hiccups. If you are lucky enough to stay at one of their sea-facing, top floor rooms, you’ll also enjoy a great view of the Pattaya Coast and all the fun (foam parties, games) at the beautiful XL Swimming Pool below which I consider the largest (if not one of the largest) that you’ll see in Pattaya.
The front office staffs are mostly cool and friendly. A special note to JJ though for helping me out and upgrading my large group to sea-facing, higher floor rooms (I had booked 2 rooms). I got a jasmine infused welcome drink, cold towels and welcoming smiles - fairly typical of any Hard rock hotel. 
The rooms are decently sized with the purple color theme prevalent all through out the room and the hotel. The bathroom was also good enough but the beds and pillows were not the best of my liking. The room had all other usuals – LCD TV with enough premium channels, pay per view movies, a music player, alarm clock, safe, coffee maker, toiletries, umbrella, etc – all that you would normally expect and more from a Hard Rock hotel.
Room service and housekeeping were a different story. Our requests for refills for the in-room tea and coffee sachets were constantly ignored – almost like telling us that “we only give you 2 sachets of tea, coffee, creamer and sugar per day so, don’t ask for it again until the next 24 hours”. Many calls later with still no response, I just went ahead and bought refills from 7/11 and used it for the remaining duration of the stay - not bothering the housekeeping or the room service again!
Breakfasts at the main restaurant below were quite good with enough selections to satiate your morning hunger pangs but their lunch and dinner buffets need improvement. My first lunch and dinner buffets on my first day was a delight – with tiger prawns, fish, lamb and an assortment of continental veggies but I was disappointed to find almost the same menu, almost verbatim in my repeat visits.
It was also especially sad to see the awkward faces of many of my fellow guests at the hotel – Malaysians, Indians and Muslims of various nationalities who seem to be aplenty there (compared to typical westerners or Thais) – not relishing the buffet selections at all due to the presence of many Pork selections and the mostly continental style of the menu. I remember seeing one guest actually complaint about this to the manager but strangely it seemed to have no effect at all and the menu with the over powering presence of pork was present on all days. One evening I did see Chicken Tikka and Mutton Biryani in the menu but it was awfully bland - nothing like I have tasted anywhere in India or elsewhere! No doubt, none of the Indians I could see seemed to enjoy them either!
I once had a Chicken Pizza and Red wine at their Pizza joint near the pool at around 9 PM with a friend. I had also asked the hostess there for some regular drinking water but after serving us 2 glasses of water, she curtly reminded me that I had to buy a bottle or she won’t serve us any water. Not in the mood to question her, I simply ordered for a bottle of some super, expensive Mineral water – Evian, I guess. 
The Hard Rock Café was a much better affair with much better service than I expected with nice bands in the evenings but they ruin the fun by closing early. Even their other restaurants inside the hotel including the main resto close too early by Pattaya standards. The buffets open and close early in the evening - if you go like 10ish in the night, the buffet is almost done! Pattaya is a fun city and it’s full of life all night so it’s a little perplexing why Hard Rock of all hotels should close so early! 
I am a Hard Rock fan and I will certainly go again but I hope it’s high time; the folks behind the scenes wake up to what guests want and cater to their needs than the other way round!",WebTurista,Date of stay: May 2012,4,"New York City, New York",Trip type: Traveled with friends,3-Value,4-Rooms,5-Location,3-Cleanliness,2-Service,3-Sleep Quality,,

The facilities re also very well rounded. The pool is awesome, and had a kids area along with some fun activities like basketball in it. The gym and spa are great too. We also really liked the ambience of the hotel, the decor and the lounge etc.! 
The issues we had were more related to service and the cleanliness of the room. We had cockroaches in our bathroom, and even after complaining to the room service at 9.30pm at night, no one showed up to address the issue till the next morning. I also saw cockroaches the next morning in the dining area. Now, Pattaya is a tropical location and bugs are expected, but cockroaches in your room or anywhere near food - that is a no no! 
Further, when we ate at the Hard Rock Cafe, I left my spectacles there and when I went back later to check, the staff was very unresponsive to my queries. Needless to say, I did not find my spectacles. :(

1. Great Mattress/ Bed Quality
2. Decent View
3. AMAZING breakfast (Don't miss this even if you are partying all of previous night) - great selection of Thai food including western stuff - don't miss the noodles in bsoup
4. Probably the best pool in Pattaya + best pool bar - we missed the Foam party but some of my friends who were there said is was better that the rubbish on walking street
5. Access to beach - just across the road - can't spend the entire day chilling
6. Fairly pleasant and helpful staff - the hard rock atmosphere helps - English speaking is a bit of a challenge for some of the staff
Things that can be improved
1. Weird design of the bathroom - the shower has some kind of a tiled bathtub that you need to step in and out of
2. There was no water at the time of check-in in the bathroom - came in around a couple of hours
3. At US$ 160 a room per night (twin sharing inclusive of breakfast) I thought it was slightly overpriced for the quality of room we had
4. Construction work/ renovation was on - the drills were really really loud and heard all across the lift shafts & rooms",Zia H,Date of stay: November 2010,4,Mumbai,Trip type: Traveled with friends,2-Value,4-Rooms,4-Location,4-Cleanliness,3-Service,5-Sleep Quality,,

I found the staff around the pool a bit full on but I suppose it is just in line with the theme of the place.
The pool is excellent and the beach area is great especially for kids who love playing around and sitting on the big boulders.
I was dissapointed to discover the bottom of the pool to be quite dirty with  lots of green stuff growing between the tiles on the bottom of the pool especially around the  tiled Hard Rock Sign.
I also found it dissapointing that with the water being non-palatable that they charge guests for any ice ordered from room service.Interestingly enough it is not mentioned anywhere on the room service menu that there will be a 59 baht charge for ice.
I also found it interesting that for a four star hotel called the Hard Rock Hotel that there was not one potato dish on the breakfast buffet for the whole time we stayed there.There were three different rice dishes , congee(two types),chicken or pork rice and japanese rice. Sausages were also scarse only appearing once during our stay.
I joked with my partner that prehaps they should change the name from Hard Rock Hotel to Hard Wok Hotel as they were definately not catering to all guests.
The rooms were on the small side as was the bathroom.We were orginally in a delux king room which had a northerly aspect but changed to a delux twin with a southerly  view (more interesting) and actually felt that the twin room was larger as it had a large bench under the bathroom window(which opens into the main room) which the king room didn't have. the rooms were very clean and well kept.
On the friday before we left they were setting up for a function around the pool at about 3pm. This involved removing at least 60% of the sun lounges which were stacked on top of each other out of the way. The pool was open until 10pm for hotel guests and when  I came down at 3:30pm there were no sun lounges available as most of them were stacked away and the rest occupied. The cabanas were empty but you had to pay 400baht to use one,so several of us had no other option but to lay our towel out on the sand area around the artificial beach area which reminded of my childhood visits to the beach.",PJ-707,Date of stay: October 2006,3,AUSTRALIA,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,3-Value,3-Rooms,4-Location,4-Cleanliness,4-Check in / front desk,3-Service,,

I don't know if a hotel can claim anonymity to be a one of their selling points- but the HRH is exactly that. Completely unremarkable. 
Food was borderline bad at breakfast, i must say- and there is general confusion surrounding it. On the day i checked in, i was told that breakfast is open till 11AM, only to take a walk to the Starz Diner and be told it closes at 10:30. The staff are exemplary- polite, courteous and seem friendly. But for the sort of money paid for the stay, i would've expected a helluva lot more.

I think this is the most difficult part to rate a Hard Rock Hotel.
Decoration of lobby is great with memorabilia. 
Corridors are a little bit dark as they are black painted with purple lights.
Rooms are good, but doesn't makes you feel staying in a HRH as special decoration is only 4 small frames with pictures of rock stars (in my case Keith Richard and Santana) and a small guitar on the pillows.
Breakfast is just fine but nothing special. 
The shower on the roof was not working, so I had to use the hand shower.
What is amazing is the chance of have one guitar on your room to play with it. They have around 15 fender guitars and you can choose one, after one deposit of 10,000 baths.
They take this guitar to your room in the suitcase, with a guitar effects device and earplugs, so whatever your rock style is, you can have fun in your room!!!
You can have disscount at the restaurant and the shop, but I had to ask about this, as nobody told me when I did the check in.
Location I think is one of the most competitive advantages. You can go by walk to the main hot spots in Pattaya. But also you can rent a scooter and keep it in the parking lot.
All the staff is amazingly friendly, but this is Thailand! People is friendly everywhere.
I went to the restaurant twice. I saw the band playing and their performance is nothing better than the average bands you can find in any other street bar.
Swimming pool was under maintenance, and maybe you don't need it, and for sure after this repairing will look awesome.
Bed sheets were not really soft.
HRH claims take care about the planet and save water, as many others hotels they ask you if you want to keep the same towel just leave on the hanger or somewhere else and if want to change it just drop it to the floor. Everyday I kept my wet towels on the bed, the chair or hung in the bathroom and everyday I found a new towel perfectly dry and folded. I appreciate the attention of the room keeper, but makes me thing HRH don't walk the talk about saving water.",spiderman_gfc,Date of stay: October 2016,3,"Mexico City, Mexico",Trip type: Traveled solo,null,null,null,null,null,null,,

Hard Rock epitomises the word Rock and Roll with great decor in their lobby ...real memoribilia of all the famous music icons! 
Staff-The reception, the housekeeping and the restaurants' staff are all very courteous, friendly and extremely helpful
Rooms- The room we stayed in a standard room was slightly small in terms of where to keep luggage and stuff, but the beds are very comfortable and spacious and we had a balcony that overlooked the pool!
Food- The food at hard rock is slightly overpriced, but the hard rock website has some good offers n promotions that give you breakfast and room combos, bbq dinner and room combos and other offers. The BBQ dinner is amazing with a great spread of meats, desserts and main course. The only downside is it was open only till 10pm which is too early for a dinner to be shut! 
Activities and entertainment- Hard Rock Pattaya is a great family hotel which has a wide range of activities for kids and adults. While adults can take part in water polo, table tennis and other sporting activities, kids have lots of options throughout the day from face painting, to kiddie competitions.
Spa- The spa at hard rock is heavenly with a wide range of treatments though on the slightly more expensive side. Great for couples who want to relax!

We have been trying a few hotels in Pattaya over the last few months searching for the one that meets our needs. We have a 3 year old son and it's important for us that he has activities and a good pool to enjoy. We had paid for the Kings club package for the duration of our stay.
We arrived early and were quickly taken to the 9th floor for the Kings club check in. What can I say but the check in was fantastic, quick, given an overview of all the hotel facilities and club package. We were early and didn't expect our room to be ready but it was and shown to our room. We booked a deluxe city view, it was very clean and modern, perfectly big enough and was a high standard in my opinion.
We went to the lounge at 6pm for package cocktails, beer and food- it was fantastic and a special mention for Chanel who was so very friendly and looked after our drinks orders. The food is great and other hotels should aspire to this level when doing a club package!
Breakfast was included in our room rate, again choice of food was great- fresh, loads of choice and so very clean with attentive staff. 
The feeling of great customer service is all round the hotel. The pool is fantastic, a great concept of a beach area which our son loved, we rented the cabana for the pool party and its great!
This hotel is a credit to the manager and his team, it's now become our weekend getaway! We loved it all and this has my ranking as my favourite hotel in Pattaya, thank you!! Book as I don't see how anyone could be disappointed.....

The rooms here are great... very large by Asian standards, clean, modern... complimentary beer in the mini-bar etc.
The outside pool area here is amazing too... I rented a cabana one day and just lazed around the huge pool all day long. You can also order food service directly from your cabana!
In the morning I had the complimentary breakfast buffet which was first class.... several chefs served up personalized omelets etc.
Outstanding food!

1) Very good location , just 15 min walk to walking street and easy access and taxi availability on both sides Beach road and 2nd road.
2) Huge pool with beach theme.
3) Rooms are clean and sea view is great.
4) Breakfast has a huge variety.
5) Sat foam party is one of the best party in pattaya.
Cons
1)  front desk staffs were not welcoming and friendly. I loft my key in my room and when i asked for duplicate key , the lady made such a bad face as if i have asked for her life .

However, the Hard Rock is without a doubt one of the best hotels on the beach front, with a gorgeous pool area and rooms overlooking the stunning beach. There is endless entertainment for both kids and adults, plus of course the plethora of eateries on site - including the actual Hard Rock Cafe Pattaya. The breakfast was the best I have ever seen offered in a hotel and although very little Thai food was available, this seemed to be the case across Pattaya - it is very much aimed at the Western tourist.

The hotel is huge with so many activities for everyone. We were in Pattaya for 2 days and trust me this hotel made us feel a week would be less to see pattaya and enjoy this property
We were given the sea view rooms and the rooms were very neat clean, smelling nice and spacious.
The front desk staff was a little slow in check in process, but while we were had to wait we were welcomed with really hot face towels which freshened us after the drive from BKK, they also served us some welcome drink but the way it was served was weird. firstly we were 6 of us and they served only 4 portions, secondly they use a relatively large glass for the serving and hence fill it only till like close to 1 quarter which when served looks bad, i mean one could use a smaller glass and serve the smaller helping rather than use a large glass which almost looks like the left over of the previous guest.
But anyways finally we were allotted our rooms and since the rooms were good we were happy.
A quick short nap and then we were all ready to take a dip in the pool, they have a very nice huge pool in about 3 segments, with a few pool games and a nice bar serving drinks while you chill in the pool or by the pool.
the hotel is situated in the middle of everything, so all you need to do is step out and take a tuk tuk or van and hop off where ever you want
Breakfast was lovely with a huge spread and a good selection for kids too.
i would definitely recommend this property to anyone for a very very good comfy stay in Pattaya",kkunal,Date of stay: October 2013,5,"Bengaluru, India",Trip type: Traveled with family,5-Value,5-Rooms,5-Location,4-Cleanliness,4-Service,4-Sleep Quality,,

The lounge is available all day for complimentary soft drinks, and there is a cocktail hour (6:30pm-8:00pm), where they serve delicious snacks (sushi, cheeses, cooked fish, chicken goujons, fresh mussels & prawns etc.), with a change of dishes every night.

The hotel is very stylish with its unique design. The wall is decorated with many types of guitars and picture of guitarists. The view on that hotel is beautiful, you can see the ocean all the way from your room. 
At this hotel, the foods are terrific. I ordered the wagyu beef burger charcoal grill, the bun is very rich and the beef is very tender. It comes with fries and salad. We ordered pepperoni pizza with olive and it was truly amazing. And nn the morning, you’ll get a really nice breakfast buffet.
There's many choices for movies or TV shows you can choose too! At 3:30 pm there's a bubble party at the pool, unfortunately I didn't join the party but it was a very nice concept. The pool is very different from other places, there's 2 zones on the pool, there's a place with sands so you would feel like you’re actually at the beach and the other zone was a regular pool with 160 cm deep or 5 feet 2 inches. In the morning, you’ll get a really nice breakfast buffet. 
I think this hotel is almost perfect, but overall, it is a really nice hotel that you must try, you’ll never regret it. Hard Rock Hotel is one of the most unique hotel I’ve ever been with its clever design of decorating the wall with expansive guitars, making you feel like you’re at the concert.",San Vipatr K,Date of stay: October 2015,4,,Trip type: Traveled with friends,3-Value,5-Cleanliness,5-Service,null,null,null,,

But for me there are many better values on and around beach road for what you get at the Hard Rock. The food is ""way"" over priced (in my opinion) 650 baht for a pizza? You can buy a beautiful large pizza a block away on 2nd road for 250 baht. Also, i felt they try to cheap out on the little things like soap and towels (no face cloth). I guess I just expected a lot more from a hotel at this price point. I did like the staff, they all were extremely nice. The pool area is nice but again, you have to pay extra for things like floats and cabanas, they get you at every turn money wise. Lastly, the hotel is really far from Walking Street which can be bothersome especially when it rains.

Not only did the location of the hotel is perfect for a nice solo trip around Pattaya city, the hospitality and service shown by the staff there is enough to make you want to just stay in the hotel and enjoy.
One thing though, I chose the Rock Royalty room and honestly speaking, was a bit disappointed with it. The staff handling my check in and check out was extremely friendly and helpful and first evening cocktail and breakfast was divine. However, the problem started on the 23rd of September's evening cocktail: not only was the lounge crowded and the food wasn't enough, there was hardly any space left not sit. When we finally managed to sit, the staff didn't even acknowledge us or even take our order and chose to serve another family who arrived like 20 minutes after we arrived. My mood for the night was dampened as I just took a cookie and a pastry and headed straight out. Never did the evening cocktail anymore after that experience.
Nonetheless. the dining experience at Rock Starz Cafe was splendid. Menu was varied enough but I was disappointed that there were no Thai Spring Rolls though. The front desk staff were extremely helpful with all my enquiries and even helped me list down all my options for airport transport options.

Having lived in Thailand 25 years I'm well aware there are better places to spend your time in this amazing country.  So I always try to persuade my son to spend his birthday trip in other places.  No way.  It always has to be Hard Rock Hotel.
Coming only 1-2 times year (this was our 5th trip) I'm always hesitant just because it's in Pattaya but the moment I arrive I realize why we love it so much.
This trip we had some very last minute scheduling problems and I was sure we would have to cancel and be charged for it.  Hard Rock did their best to help us move our stay to another date and charged us nothing.  I was stunned and so very grateful to be honest.
Finally arriving to our Family Suite we were greeted to cake and an assortment of free drinks.  It wa say sons birthday and they had set this up for us without me even requesting.  I was a happy mom with a very happy 11 yr old.
Unfortunately the pool was under renovation this time but we got the Cartoon Network Package which is sooooooo worth it! We had a blast at Cartoon Network and were treated with free gifts, free entry and a free shuttle bus round trip. Yet again, another happy mom moment (not to mention even happier son).
Our room came with Rock Royalty privileges which meant we could have a more private free breakfast every morning, a lounge to stay in with a great view whenever we please and free cocktails for sunset.  The best happy mom moment (and husband was happy too).
I can't fault this place at all.  Food, rooms, service, cleanliness all amazing.  
Yes its a bit pricey compared to other options but what you get is so much more and that is thanks to the staff.  I've never met an unfriendly staff member here.  Ever.
So thank you Hard Rock for once again making my family so happy.  You are probably the only reason I'll step foot in Pattaya (and I think my son is happy about that).

On Saturday, there are many show as dancing, crown, balloon, stick, etc which are performed by the rockers. SPA is excellent, the therapist is very skillful.
The breakfast buffet  provide wide variety of choice. We can get our seat fast, environment is clean, staff are nice.
The Wifi is satisfactory.

The location of the hotel was good, it had a beachfront path, it was also very close to Alcazar Lady-boy Show. There were a lot of restaurants and clubs near this hotel. 
When entering this hotel, it felt like entering a mall due to Hard Rock shop upfront and their guitar displays. FYI, the shop provided VAT return form. Our check in and out process was smooth and the deposit needed was 1000 Bath. The staff were also friendly. The bellboy was very prompt when delivering and picking up our luggages. 
Our room was 517, it was a average size room with queen bed and shower only room. The TV was small but the room had a long sofa inside. The view from our room was average for us. This hotel also had a beautiful breakfast restaurant by the pool, although the foods were average for us. The hotel provided blockbuster movies for free on their TV and gave a link to download free music upon check in (we didn't try this).
Now for the very down side that we experienced, there was no free WiFi. We were quite shocked about this. We had to choose their packages during check in if we want to use their WiFi. But from my WiFi list, the WiFi itself wasn't very stable. Next, the room looked clean but I was sneezing for a while and then got runny nose, there might be some dust somewhere in the room. In the bathroom, there was no toothbrush and toothpaste provided, they also only provided conditioning shampoo (no conditioner). There was also a broken power outlet in our room, and it was the international one.

Check-In, although they were busy, was handled incredibly well and compared to the Sukothai in Bangkok, where we had just stayed, was an absolute pleasure. The room (Deluxe Seaview) was really nice.  It has been recently renovated and is modern and clean.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  The rate we got included breakfast.  The breakfast was more than adequate, but the restaurant was quite crowded and busy.  The staff were really patient with us and didn't rush us to leave when breakfast was wrapping up.  We rented a Cabana each day to lounge by the pool and it was well worth it (especially with the lil' guy).  The pool area is great with slides for the kids and a sand area where the little ones can run around.  The only complaint I have about the pool area is that the stairs to the slides is very poorly designed and in my opinion rather dangerous for children.  
The location is great and it's very convenient to the new mall and easy access to the beach.  If you're up for it - it's a nice walk along the beach to walking street.

Hard Rock Pattaya did not meet our expectations like other hotel did. First, front desk staffs were not welcoming and friendly. We saw cold faces and our room type wasn't ready the time we checked in (we booked a Deluxe City View DBL). We were asked to pick between Deluxe City View TWIN or an upgrade to Deluxe Sea View Disabled room. As we were told that the only difference was the bathroom, so we chose the upgrade. Second, our room was not clean. Black stains on bath towels, bedsheets, dusty bathroom, broken pillow case (the guitar logo area) and dirty carpet, HSKP needs to put more efforts on this please! No new bottles of shower gel or shampoo was provided on the next day after making up our room. We couldn't be bothered to request again as we had brought own own toiletries luckily! Note that no toothbrush, toothpaste, slippers is provided at this Hard Rock, do bring your own. Third, breakfast was satisfactory. It comes with many choices. The Thai noodle soup was my favourite. Comfy dining area. 
One thing i would like to compliment on Hard Rock Pattaya is their Security Staffs. They have the best smiling faces at your hotel. We could see they welcomed us ""home""....

Overall I was impressed with reception, the general cleanliness of the hotel, and its location.  My room was basic, but perfectly adequate for what I needed.  Breakfast, which was included in my room rate was quite good.  Made to order omelets, fruit, cereal, tea, and coffee were quite good.  I was not that impressed with the pool area.  Compared to other hotels in the area I think there a better options.  Still, the Hard Rock is fine.

The room was nice/clean and bed comfortable. The pool is down but no big deal for me. The breakfast is fine but I will caution expats that the Thai's use MSG in almost everything so one needs to ask and request not to include it. I can pick up on it immediately.
As a separate issue the Hard Rock has ""Save the Earth"" as one of their business themes. I have to question their commitment to ""walking the walk"". The small toiletries (lotion, soap and shampoo) in the bathrooms are black and do indicate the recycle triangle on the bottom but I failed to see a container for recyclables in the rooms or on the room cleaners carts as I walked to the elevators.

I have booked the pickup over the Hard Rock Hotel and it was worth the money to enjoy the drive in a relaxing most confortable car with a perfect driver (mentionable perfect as I hardly feel safe and relaxed in Asian taxi .. ) I also used the transport to go for the Sanctuary of truth  for a tour on the next day- it was again worth the money as the driver brought me, arranged everything, give me tips to enjoy the site and waited for me until I finished my tour.
I will always remember especially the two evenings at the Soul Bar, because the host Felicia was simply great and the Blackvelvet liveband is exceptional - a bunch of exceptional personalities having pure music running through their veins and providing the best soundtrack for two exceptional, legendary evenings (Even now I just start to smile when I just think about the evenings/ Hope they never loose their great spirit and the ability to make others simply happy and they themselves feel the positive energy they provide to others also themselves).
All employees are simply great, always smiling, always helping, ensuring a great and relaxing atmosphere .. no issues to fulfill extra wishes, no problems- just solutions. For example I saw some nice adapted T-shirt with some cutouts in the shop- unfortunately not my size but when I asked they organized that the next day the shirt was available my size- without any issues.

Stayed in a Roxstars family suite overlooking the ocean.  The check in staff were excellent on the 9th floor.  The suite (on the 10th floor) was amazing with separate room for hubby and I and a little nook with bunk beds for my son who felt special in his own little space and had his own bathroom.  Our room was just gorgeous with a beautiful view of the ocean and all around Pattaya.  Bed was super comfortable, pillows were perfect (not too hard or soft) so sleep quality was excellent here.  Bathroom was really roomy with a huge bathtub in it.  There were 2 tvs in our suite (1 for my son's area and 1 in our bedroom) and plenty of good channels including free new release movies.  We also had 2 balconies - a small one which opened in the corner of our bedroom and another large balcony from the lounge room.
Breakfast was a very good mix of asian and western.  I loved having noodles each day - it varies each day but the chicken noodles were just to die for - absolutely delicious!
Pool area is massive combining both concrete pool areas and there was a little beach area attached with various water slides which my son loved.  There was also an area of the littler kids with a playground within a pool.  There were all sort of pool games each day and other fun activities for the kids such as rock climbing (which was free at various times of the day).  There was also a supervised kids club that you can leave your children to play in for THB100 per hour per child (which is an absolute bargain) - they can play xbox/playstation or watch a movie or just hang out.  
By far, the best thing about staying at this hotel was the staff particularly the pool and the lounge (level 9) staff.

I booked a room in the Kings Club lounge and requested to have room near my friends who will stay at the same hotel at the same period. This requested is not entertained.
We have breakfast at the lounge on 9/F. While kids were playing iPad in the lounge, I went back to my room to go to toilet. Surprisingly, I found my luggage was searched by someone, and there were ""orange"" coloured stains on some of my clothes. I also found out that my daughter FROZEN bracelet was stolen.
I lodged my complain to the manager ANN. She got all the cleaners to come to my room and questioned them in front of me. This is ridiculous. How would the theft admit that she has stolen things in my room. The manager explained to me that no cleaner has stolen my daughter's bracelet. However, she failed to explain why my luggage was so messy with stains.
In the afternoon, she told me that my daughter bracelet was found in the lounge. This was impossible because she cannot take it off by herself, the bracelet is a leather one with button, not easy to take it off by kids.
Another bad experience is about the car. I booked a van for 2000 THB for a return trip from hotel to Cartoon Network waterpark. In our return trip, the driver came to pick up with his girlfriend sitting in the front. We have six people, my friend has to sit at the dog seat at the back with the luggage.

Stayed in a club room, the room was not as large as I expected but having said that it was adequate. The room was always kept spotlessly clean by housekeeping. 
Staying in a club room allowed access to the club lounge, serving breakfast in a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere, free tea, coffee and snacks were also available throughout the day with free cocktails and snacks from 18-00 to 19-30 in the evening. The staff at the club lounge were great, making me feel that little bit special.
This was my 5th visit to Pattaya staying at various hotels and the staff at the Hard Rock were simply the best, a credit to the hotel, nothing was too much trouble for them. I send my thanks to all of the staff of the hotel. 
The facilities and activities were incredible, from rock climbing, pool volleyball, pool handball and more should you feel energetic enough. The pool is large with plenty of sun loungers around, there is a pool bar with attentive staff serving food and drinks, the guy's here at ""The Shack"" also deserve a special mention.
Apart from the main restaurant, ""The Starz"" the other bars and restaurants were always very quiet. There are cheaper bars and restaurants close to the hotel which I think many of the guests were using. This is not a hotel for those on a budget but if you want a distinctive and somewhat exclusive hotel, I would highly recommend The Hard Rock.

Do yourself a favour and give the city a miss - unless of course you want to go on holidays to a place where 80% of the people there are male sex tourists.
If you do decide to go then the Hard Rock seems to be one of the more reasonable places to stay in the city and is located on the beach about 15 minutes from Walking Street. The Hard Rock is quite family friendly which is good as Pattaya is definitely not a place you want to take your kids. The pool is big and has a kids area with slides and shallow water. The pool is surrounded by cabanas with king sized day beds which can be rented daily. These are great for taking a break from the sun or a midday snooze. 
The hotel and its rooms have been recently renovated but it is obvious it is a makeover not a total renovation. That said they are clean and comfortable but small. The whole hotel had a feeling of being a bit small. 
We booked a Kings Club room as we specifically wanted some extra space and a balcony - as indicated on the photos of this room type on the web. As it turns out only some of these rooms have balconies. We did ask to be moved and they did try to accommodate our request but the rooms they showed us were smaller than what we were in originally. After a lot of messing about we were given an upgrade for the last couple of nights to a family suite which was nice and I would recommend it to families. However, it is very expensive and I don't think it is worth the extra price. The Club Lounge is on one of the upper floors and you can have a drink or snacks there throughout the day. There is also a cocktail hour in the evening. 
Overall, we have stayed at other Hard Rocks which we would visit again but in comparison Hard Rock Pattaya was a bit under par and we wouldn't rush back here again.",LisaRuhanen,Date of stay: August 2012,3,"Brisbane, Australia",Trip type: Traveled with family,2-Value,2-Rooms,3-Location,3-Cleanliness,3-Service,3-Sleep Quality,,

In fact... It was an excuse to gontonpattaya otherwise I wouldn't have bothered!
The hotel itself is fine, however for the money there is FAR better available in pattaya. 
Checking was friendly enough although the broken English didn't help resolve basic questions. That is being a little picky, as afterall, being in a foreign country, it would be ignorant to expect English to be spoken perfectly each time. That being said, hard rock generally employs staff who are fully conversant and often multi-lingual, however this time fell short.
The room was ok. On check in there were no double beds left, just a twin consisting of 2 queen beds. Nothing was offered by way of compensation - no voucher for the shop or even a checking cocktail - all of which are more than in the bounds of what should be fairly easy to provide.
The bathroom was nice althought the shower was lacking in pressure - albeit a nice rain shower head - very little in the way of pressure...  The toiletries were lacking, and there weren't even the usual vanity items such as cotton buds etc which you would expect from a hotel at that price tag and especially one which provides a ""rockstar"" experience!
The room itself was spacious, and quirky, although attention to detail in most cases was extremely lacking.  Furniture was showing signs of wear and tv was surprisingly small.
Food... Food was excellent. From breakfast throug to the HRC. Cannot fault it at all, however the cocktails were not upmtomthe usual HRC standards.
We stayed on Halloween and were looking fwd to a kiss tribute act. What can't say? I have never been subjected to such an awful din in all my life (I served my time as a roadie)... They we simply awful and couldn't hold a note. That being said, the place was crawling with tv cameras and local press... For sme reason, these guys were being classed as celebrities... In my opinion, stick with the house band. Although a little jumbled in terms of set and style, they we pitch perfect and entertaining.
The pool area is exquisite and the facilities for kids and teens are second to none. There are a couple of other bard in the complex which are well appointed and have a nice ambience.
Spa treatments amazingly expensive - around 5-7 times more expensive than the private spas less than 100m away!
Would I stay again? Definitely not. Would I stay at a hard rock hotel again? Maybe...
Bottom line is if you are looking for a hotel representing the hard rock ethos, I wouldn't bother with this one unless you have kids. There are many many superior hotels in pattaya for the same or less money.
However if you're in pattaya, please check out the restaurant. Food cannot be faulted!",Inverness_Travel,Date of stay: October 2012,3,"Linlithgow, United Kingdom",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,3-Value,3-Rooms,4-Location,5-Cleanliness,4-Service,3-Sleep Quality,,

Ours had a balcony side ways facing the sea.  We were staying on a Bed & Breakfast basis and we were pleased to discover breakfast is served up to 10:30 a.m...  useful for those  UK travellers that are jet lagged 😴.  A very comprehensive variety of food is available for breakfast for all appetites.......noodles and rice, traditional British fried breakfast, indian curry and samosas or pastries and cereals.  Staff very helpful. Dinner is also served here...a choice of open buffet or choice from the a la carte menu.
There's a beautiful pool which has rocks and sand giving the illusion of being by the sea. Staff by the poolside restaurant were also very friendly and kind as were reception staff on our arrival.  Staff were always happy to assist from the doorman up to the bar manager.  The Hotel has a Saturday night poolside party free to residents with a live group which attracts paying guests from other hotels... the pyrotechnics are incredible. Guitars and photo memorabilia of the rolling stones and the Beatles adorn the walls. All in all this is the best hotel we have stayed in in Pattaya.  There's something for everyone young or old.

I stay at the Tahoe and Las Vegas properties regularly but this experience is worth commenting on if you are planning a stay. 
*There is good and bad about this property and I will mention both in this review.
First thing I noticed as I arrived on the property to the check in and onto my room is the number of ads offering additional services for sale.  You literally can not look anywhere and not see an ad for a promotion, a service, something for sale.  
The second, and I find this very strange.  When making reservations, if you log in with your email address the same reservation jumps in price.  I mentioned this to the staff and was told that should not happen and was likely a temporary error.
*I checked every day as I was very curious and this occurred each of the days I was on the property. 
The Good:  
- They have an awesome Steam Room, Sauna and Cold Dip pool set-up.  It is often empty so a great place to relax. 
 
- Having lockers to rent free of charge while at the pool is great addition. 
- Wifi coverage on the property is excellent and should be highlighted as a job well done.  Better than the Hilton down the street.
- Bar staff is excellent.  Consistently interacted with top notch bar staff and managers.  A+
Summary:  
Hard Rock Pattaya is a safe place to stay with a nice pool and friendly service staff.  It is not set-up as a relaxing resort to get away from it all, but rather an example of a customer being thrown through a sales and marketing funnel while on their vacation.",M G,Date of stay: September 2018,2,"San Jose, California",Trip type: Traveled with family,2-Value,3-Rooms,4-Service,null,null,null,,

The location is across the road on Pattaya Beach which was good actually. While my fellow traveller was all ga-ga with the name and fame, I found the place lacking decent service standards. Here is how:
The check in was a prolonged affair and I had to twice tell the receptionist to speed up things after a long ride from Bangkok. The staff was almost non-challant while welcoming guests like they were Martians. The front desk girl kept asking for a deposit even after paying for the entire stay which i always do at all hotels. Then she refunded back the deposit when I handed over cash to her, like she was checking whether I had money with me or not
The breakfast again was a damp squib. Not a lot of variety. When I asked for a cup of coffee, again the staff conveniently forgot and I walked out without a cuppa
Check out process was again disheartening, when the counter staff tells you: wait we will check your room even after 20 minutes of informing the guy, to settle the bill, are guests there thieves? And in the present digital world even if the guest walks out stealing a few things of the mini-bar, the guests credit card can always be re-charged.
The last nail on the coffin:
We asked the concierge to get a taxi for Bangkok from outside the hotel gate, he promptly refused. What guts the man had. What is a concierge of a hotel there for? I remember in Singapore, where a concierge went out of the way to even book a Grab Cab for me, and here the guy has the gall to say no to a guest. That shows the training and the top management of the hotel's attitude, how they train their staff.
Well, we walked with our bags around 100 metres ( a first ever in an international trip) and lo and behold, 5 taxis were standing right outside the hotel gate.
Well, the rooms are ok, the hotel has nothing to boast about except for its infamous foam swim parties.

The moment I set foot on to the hotel, its culture was immediately reflected by the fantastic music and the very warm welcome. The staff always delivered above expectation.
Hardrock hotel Pattaya is extremely well managed. Its is by far and away the most well run hotel in Pattaya and probably Thailand. The staff are extremely professional and have the hard rock culture embedded on them. It is rare to find hotel staff with a culture like the ones at Hardrock. 
The check-in and check-out process were extremely efficient. The rooms were delightful, could have been bigger but acceptable non the less. The view from the deluxe room made all the difference, one of the most beautiful views in Pattaya. We were 7 people and since we were regular guests at the hotel, Mr. Ralph & Mrs. Ann upgraded all our rooms to the deluxe. Hardrocks gesture of kindness to old guests makes all the difference.
Hardrock has one of the best pools in all of Thailand. The staff at the pool ensure that activities are run all day long. You will get to play stuff like water polo and water volleyball. Kids also get to play special games like water balloons among others. The pool has entertainment for everyone regardless of age. You can't be at the Hardrock and not have an awesome time.
The food at the hotel is highly recommended. The burger at the dinner is by far and away the most delicious burger I've personally ever had. Their Tom Yom is also phenomenal. As for breakfast and dinner buffets, the food was good. The cuisine was mostly international. The Staff at the dinner and buffets made all the difference again. You won't wait to look around to find someone to help you, it was very well run.
We went to stay at the Hilton after the Hardrock and it was evident from the first moment that Hilton was understaffed. The staff weren't as professional as Hardrock, they also weren't as efficient and as effective. Kudos to the management of Hardrock for making the place what it is today. I personally preferred Hardrock Pattaya over Hilton and will be back. 
Special thanks go to Mr. Ralph for making our stay memorable, he tried his utmost to make our trip phenomenal. Ms. Ann also deserves our deep appreciation for making us feel at home, Hardrock wouldn't feel home without her, she went out of her way to make us happy. Third, I wanted to thank Tanya for her hospitality and for the effort she put in to make us comfortable.

On entering the hotel lobby you are taken back by the decor and the rock memorabilia which is positioned throughout, there is definitely a fun and funky feel to it which is carried on throughout the hotel. 
My room was no different, with its black bathroom and red colour theme throughout the bedroom. We had a small balcony and our view looked out to the city, next time I would go for the sea view. Personally for me I think the rooms could be a little larger having just come from a hotel in BKK which was twice the size for less money, but that's just a personal preference.
The pool area is fantastic with a huge pool and the beach area is a nice touch. The cabanas which you can rent for 700 Baht are also good for just chilling out and watching the world go by. I have to make a special mention to the guys who work in the Shack bar, really good fun and nothing is too much trouble they took the time to speak to everyone and make them feel part of the good atmosphere around the pool area. It should be noted that construction works are taking place next to the pool area and next door to the hotel, which could spoil the tranquility that some maybe looking for.
Food at the hotel is to a very high standard, as you would expect, however, it is on the high side price wise; so if you are on a budget this might not be the place for you. The breakfast selection was vast with every nationality catered for. The Soul Lounge is also another cool place to chill-out on an evening before heading out, again the price is on the high side compared to bars outside, but again you pay for what you get and the service in here and drinks selection is what you are paying for.
We did visit the Hard Rock Cafe one night and found it to be far too loud, we couldn't even talk to one another across the table, this was a shame as we had to take our drinks outside.
Wifi throughout all areas of the hotel is very fast, in fact it's the best I've ever experienced whilst staying in a hotel in South East Asia.
Taxi from the hotel to BKK Airport was booked direct from the hotel and cost 2600 Baht, bit step but as I've mentioned you pay for what you get. The car was clean, well maintained and even had wifi available, which I thought was a really cool touch.
Overall our stay at the hard Rock was fantastic and i would definitely return again in the future.",spylee76,Date of stay: October 2015,4,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,,

We stayed in a club room for 1 week and the room as such was really nice except for the total lack of store space. Our room was on the 9th floor (non smoking) at the end of the wing (room 906) with a small but very nice balcony with city view (over the reception). The balcony was actually the best feature of all for us. There was a good, but quite dark, modern bathroom with all amenities we could wish for. The room was quiet and the air con worked well although we only used it on a few occasions. The beds were quite hard as usual in Thailand. The TV had a feature that showed our current bill - do not look at it - we had a shock as the bill was 4 x the correct amount after two days. A print out at the reception showed the right amount though.
The club rooms have access to a lounge on the 9th floor (where you also check in and out) and the lounge was a very pleasant surprise. We had breakfast there every day to avoid the crowds in the downstairs breakfast restaurant - and in the evening, they offered free snacks and drinks. Normally, an evening event like that can be a very boring affair but we actually enjoyed the busy buzz and the very good service in the lounge during happy hour. We sat outside every night on a balcony overlooking the beach road which was very nice. A club room also offered us a 15% discount on food and beverages in all outlets of the hotel which was a nice feature.
The pool area was under re-construction which we of course accepted but even without the construction site, the pool had a strange layout. The pool is very large with a ""beach"" on one side with cabanas for rent - which we think is very strange in a hotel. The swim up bar is situated so you have to go under a barrier to the ""beach"" side or walk through the sand. If you sit at the tables at the pool bar to have your (quite expensive but good) lunch, people may be playing basket ball right next to you and you will experience splashing and a ball hammering against a board right next to you. Not very inviting. One day during our lunch, the staff set up a basket ball game while we were having lunch so we had to move. Strange - because the pool is huge so why does it have to be right next to the pool bar??
Besides the construction work at the pool, there is a large construction going on next door so at the moment, there is a LOT of noise at the pool. And we are not that sensitive to noise. There were many mosquitoes at the pool - also during day time - and we had a lot of stings until we realized where we got them and put on some repellent. 
The pool bar serves the best Wagyu Burger we ever had - expensive but amazing!!
The location of the hotel is fine - the baht busses make it very easy to get around (although they circle because Beach Road is a one way street). It is also easy to just walk out the door and grab something to eat - there are plenty of restaurants nearby. Try walking North to Gulliver's - a nice restaurant with outside dining.
We did not use the spa - we went to have the ""spa menu"" but it was extremely expensive. We guessed that because there was no pricing in the leaflet in the room which is never a good sign. Around 1500 THB for a Thai massage was too much for us.
Service in Hard Rock Hotel in general was really good - especially in the lounge. But the personalized feel, we did not get. We expected more rock and less water/children activities so we would say that this is a great family hotel but nothing special to us ""old"" rockers.",Trane&Trane,Date of stay: November 2015,4,"Silkeborg, Denmark",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,4-Rooms,5-Service,3-Sleep Quality,null,null,null,,

This is our second time since 2007 and they have refrubished the rooms. We stayed at Deluxe (comes with two queen bed) and it's nicely done up. Carpetted floor instead of the previous tiled floor. Room facilities all as other HRH, comes complete with toiletries.
Other areas; lobby, pool side, diner were all nicely done up but lack the original HRH atmosphere. Place is clean and organised.
We did not dine in hotel at all except for breakfast, which was slightly lower than average; limited choices of hot meal. Overall service was I'd say 5/10 for a hotel in Thailand. Reception and concierge knows very little about happenings in Pattaya and was unable to help us much in that area.
Husband had planned a surprise birthday celebratin for me, however it wasnt much of surprise anymore when they delayed delivery of the birthday cake by almost an hour.
Another downer of our stay was the Saturday night foam party. We got the pool view room and therefore was very close to the pool where they held adult foam party on Saturdays. They music was extremely loud and it didnt end until 2am, which was bad for us cuz we had a 3yrs old who was trying to sleep but kept awake by the noise.
PS : Li'll Rock was lousy, lousy. Half of the room is actually a store, which I think is dangerous for a children to be around. And they don't have basic stuff for my boy to play with and yet they charge 80baht an hour. We got an hour FOC from our room package.

Theirs are really good in the room I was a hairdresser and have very long hair and theirs was perfect for my hair. 
The staff are amazing so helpful can not do enoughp, breakfast is ample lots to choose from, we booked in and had the bbq meal one evening that was really good too and you get a slight discount on price if you are staying in the hotel. 
Swimming pool is great very large and quite warm, gray pool for children lots for them to do. Nice sun beds . Don’t worry about the pool party’s there was one there when we stayed and wasn’t that loud even though our room was right near the front of the pool where they hold it. All very Civilised. 
Beach is just across the road nice beach too and the beds to hire are only 100 Bhart which is around £2.50 . 
You get a clean towel from hotel every day which you sign in and out for, so no need to take a beach towel you can use theirs. We went on a early morning trip the hotel provided us with a lunch box which was very nice too. 
All in all we would definitely go back especially to this hotel, we have never been to Thailand before but the people are so welcoming and lovely they can not do enough for you and are all smiling all the time. A wonderful Country and Pattaya whatever people say we thought it was great , you can go to the busy part or stay where it’s s but quieter .

Till recently, I used to stay at the All Seasons (which has seen better days and completely avoidable these days... I will probably write about this separately). In the last 2 visits (one was only for a few hours), I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel. 
The place really rocks!! and is lovely. The rooms with its theme backdrops of singers (mine had a huge poster of Elvis) and the corridors (on all floors), receptions, dining areas with guitars, curios, dresses belonging to different musicians are wonderful. For a rock fan like me, the music on the TV was awesome. T
The rooms are tastefully decorated, comes with a fully stocked bar fridge, a music system, internet TV and a nice bath.
The hotel has 2 entrances - one from the beach and the other one on the opposite road. Has a beautiful spa with steam/sauna/cold pool with a massage (obviously!) center and big outdoor pool.
The breakfast menu is extensive and includes food for vegetarians as well! The evening buffet dinner at the restaurant comes with seafood (and unlimited drinks).
However, this is NOT a hotel for business visitors. There is NO business center and the Hotel really cannot cater to a business meeting. I had a personal emergency and to get a photograph scanned during the night took almost 2-3 hours, with the staff not really knowing what to do.... But the staff, are very helpful, courteous and they did the best that they can...

When we checked in, we were not given wet towels and welcome drinks like the other guests. But we got free parking and an upgrade, even though my Hard Rock Rewards VIP membership had expired. Walking to the room, you could hear loud screaming from a Pattaya bar girl ""at work"". After all, Walking Street is only a 15-20 minutes walk away and even the hotel mini bar offers condoms ;) The room was nice. Nice rain shower but I would have preferred a bathtub. We had a non-smoking room but it smelled of smoke so we called housekeeping. THey offered us another room, but twin beds. We wanted king so we stayed and they sprayed. But only in the four corners. I tok the spray from the guy (no training) and showed him how to do the job properly. Funny: The ""pool view"" is not the Hard Rock pool but the neighbor hotel (Montien?). Tried the breakfast one morning and it was nice, big choice and a lot of Asian foods. Also, most guests were Korean and Japanese during our stay. The beach is acrosss the street but coming from Koh Chang we did not use the poor beach of Pattaya. Why would we, because the pool area is great. Huge pool. The staff offers animation but leaves you alone if you tell them. The only complain is that this hotel is not part of the normal franchise and will not give you Reward points for your stay or anything you buy in the hotel or souvenir shop. Same as in Penang and Bali, this hotel is independently owned. I don´t like this as it does not make sense.

Lasting impressions: pretty good too.
I love the ""rock"" theme and the guitar collection.  Reception area is very swish and comfortable.  Staff attentive, efficient and helpful.  Our room was not particularly spacious but more than adequate and very clean with excellent view.
The buffet-style breakfasts are great with an unbelievable range and quantity of food to satisfy almost any taste.
Outside, the pool area is plenty big enough and the imitation sandy beach under the palm trees is a nice touch.  There's also a smaller upper pool right alongside Beach Road.
If I had a gripe I would say I disliked the noisy organised events in the pool area.  Entertainment staff bellowing through mighty amps throughout the day spoiled the potential relaxation the pool area could offer.  If you wanted solace to read a good book in peace.... forget it!

I truly enjoyed every minute of my stay in Hard Rock Hotel, thanks to the super friendly staff, the gigantic swimming pool area, the ever-changing breakfast menu, the game room + activities, the free movies in suite, and the free guitar rental for guests. 
We stayed in the Composer Suite on the 9th floor, and it totally blew me away! Fantastic sea view, a large living room, a separate bedroom, 2 bathrooms (w/ bathtub), and 2 TVs w/ free movies. Everything you could possibly need, this room already has it. I.e. Bluetooth speaker, DVD player, umbrellas, table + chairs on the balcony, many water bottles, surprise treats on a daily basis (i.e. fruit plate, macaroons, brownies, etc...), book lights, etc.... 
They also sent a Fender Strat guitar (by request) up to my room, along with a complete setup of the pedalboard and electronics. All I had to do was pick up the axe and play! As an added bonus, they also provided a free access to the “lounge” along with free drinks + snacks between 6-7:30pm. They also let us check out later @ 1:30pm at no extra charge.

I love Hard Rock Cafe a lot in the past but this hotel totally ripped off my preference in just 2 nights!
I am still staying at this hotel now and have to wake up early in the morning for golfing. However, I am really mad and want to post this message at here at immediately! We are a group of 7 travellers and have 4 rooms starting from 9 Nov. We have different or same issues. First, 2 rooms have problems with the key card which worked intermittently. The receptionist had to swift the cards again to fix this issue. Second, one of the reading lights in my room is not working, the switch is broken but not being replaced. Besides, I really don't understand why we have to input the password whenever using the free wi-fi each time, and each room is only allowed to connect with 2 devices at the same time! I normally only stay in 5-star hotels in Thailand, no matter whether I was in Pattaya, Bangkok, Chiangmai or Phuket. For other hotels, the wi-fi can be assessed by multiple devices and I didn't have to re-type the password all the time. This is the only 5-star hotel which offers such cheap free wi-fi with mean restrictions. 
Room cleaning s poor, I made a cup of tea and left it on the table after drinking half cup on 9 Nov. The cup was still there after room cleaning! 
There are 2 bottles of water in each room which are complimentary to guests. The bottles however looks dirty. I doubt if the bottles have never been cleaned, so I bought drinking water from 7-eleven across the street. However, I took my roommate to Pattaya Memorial Hospital this morning since he has food poisoning with serious diarrhea, But I can't prove whether his sickness is really related to the bottles.
Moreover, 3 rooms has problems with the TV. My friends' rooms are fixed but it's too late for me to call for fixing it now. My room door can't close automatically too, but it's relatively minor issues.

Then, I saw by accident a small note on the desk inside the bedroom that the swimming pool was going through some repair etc etc.
Down to the pool, the noise was unbearable and so unpleasant, all day long. Besides, a ""new"" building on the other side was under construction !
I think the Hotel or the website one books the bedroom from, should inform their guests about this, so that, one can decide whether they want to stay there or not.
The water of the pool didn't look clean at all. That probably explain why.
Most of the staff around the pool looked arrogant and their only goal was to sell you things to drink or to eat. They could hardly speak English.
And it was very annoying to notice that almost all - if not all - activities, one had to pay such as kids club (very poor set up and things to do inside), water mat, football table, ping pong, wall climbing etc....Not nice and unseen before.
Finally,there are 2 young lifeguards on duty by the pool and they spend their time behind their black sunglasses playing with their mobile phones.

The food is consistently good, so I thought I'd give the Hard Rock Hotel a try on my trip to Pattaya. I was traveling with my friend and he was initially a bit reticent as he (Europe) thought HR was a 'chain like McDonalds' - lol. 
I assured him it was a little bit more upscale and should have some funky rooms. The pool in Pattaya is massive, and indeed the rooms did turn out to have a very nice design element to them. He and I were both more than happy with the location and layout.
Where the Hard Rock lost our future patronage was in the small things. I know individuals reading reviews often say ymmv (your mileage may very), but when you come expecting to be treated like a rock star and instead are treated like a number it can really leave a bad taste in your mouth.
I booked online through the HR Hotel website, there were PLENTY of rooms available for my stay, I paid online and got an email confirmation - it's super speedy just like any current hotel reservation system should be. Prices were reasonable for hotels in Pattaya.
We took a cab down from Bangkok and when we arrived we were told the 'booking office close 6pm' and 'we have no rooms' and the preceded to try to upsell us to the kings club rooms (twice the price). At 12:30am we just wanted to hit the bars not be upsold and lied to. I showed them my confirmation (actually the email and the website confirmation were still open on my laptop) and the staff were frankly stupid - they looked at it as if they had never seen these items before and did not believe we had reservations. We had to explain to them that we were very SORRY to inconvenience them, you know - trying to get our rooms and all... And they just kept their stinky-faces on the entire time.. What a Hard Rock welcome we got!!
They continued to lie and say they had no rooms, utter crap... Eventually they 'found' rooms that matched our reservation but would have to charge for them at full rate (not internet rate) until tomorrow 'IF' they can find our reservation. C'mon guys - you're staring at it on my computer. Why doesn't their booking system link up to the front desk? A mystery indeed.
The rooms of course were VERY smoky, I don't complain about that type of thing, I just wanted to shower and get out. However it really pissed my friend off and he called down and gave them some strong words (in his refined English manner). They 'upgraded' us to the kings club rooms for the night... This cost them nothing and should have been done in the first place. 
What seemed like a bit of good luck turned turned out to be more bad luck as the rooms had two small beds. While I know some visitors come for the 'beautiful' beach, I would think others come for the nightlife, and two small bed that you can't push together - hardly rock-star experience does it make. More like you're 12yo living with mom and dad. ha.
Room service - forget it, their menu is paltry and it's sectioned off into available by time. Some things are not available past 10pm, and their 24 hour room service is VERY limited. The CRAZY thing to me was that you couldn't order food from the Hard Rock Cafe (attached to the hotel) so all the good stuff (potato skins, nachos) were not available. You would think they share the same kitchen but I tell you - the food available at the hotel sucked compared to to cafe. This is reason enough not to return. 
This hotel is supposed to be guest friendly, however when I brought my 'girlfriend' home for the night she was asked 4 TIMES by 4 DIFFERENT hotel staff for her ID.. (we gave it to reception to the first guy that asked).. Two guys asked us at the elevator and one on the way to the elevator.. Talk about embarrassing, my girlfriend wanted to crawl under a rock and die as there were many other 'family' types waiting at the elevator bank. 
Lastly - as a general example of this hotel's ineptitude - I set my alarm for 10:30 so I could grab some breakfast and then hit the gym and of course I call down at 10:33 and am told they 'stop serving breakfast at 10:30am).. Fine, however on the menus in the room it clearly states 'SERVED UNTIL 11am'. I made two calls and got two different answers - one that no breakfast served past 10:30, one that said only on weekends. LOOK - if you're not going to serve until 11am don't put it on your menus as I set my alarm and checked the night before. 
As far as I'm concerned a late breakfast option would probably be a good thing for guys that party here. I'm not talking about the buffet - i TOTALLY understand that has to have a closing time. I'm talking about being able to order room-service and start off the day.
I'm hoping it's just that the Hard Rock Pattaya that is mis-managed, but my stay will CERTAINLY make me reticent to try another Hard Rock hotel, and to be honest it even taints my feelings about the Cafes... So they've gone from having a loyal fan to someone who thinks their halfwits. 

Stay here? Hope u have better luck than we did.

the good things 
 - smooth check in ( some fellow travelers had mentioned difficulties) go one room early as well, staff very courteous.
- good view from the room ( took the sea facing rooms).
- pool was big nice and clean , fun activities for the kids and also a separate area for the kids
- standard spread for the buffet ( repetitive though)
- majority staff very welcoming and pleasing personality
- across the road to the main beach ( beach crowded and dirty but maybe just one visit )
-close to the walking street but not that close  so its upto you 
Now few things which we found odd 
- why are the coca cola floats in the pool charged  200 bhat per day .... found that strange 
- i think having brown color skin does make a difference in the behavior of certain staff members ( especially the Rock Spa).. the reason did not give it a try.
- restaurant timing till 10:00 pm but they shut off at 9:30 pm ( not good if a family comes late from  a walk and it raining and cant go out for food ) .... they did have room service but still why have timings then .

still had a good overall experience

The staff speak excellent english, some even with accent, which i find amusing..hehe..very courteous and nice without being intrusing..excellent choice for breakfast which opens until 10:30am, good for us late wakers, best burgers i know of..concierge is also very helpful with ticket purchase for shows such as Tiffany's and taxi arrangements etc..very much glad to be able to move here from our previous hotel accross the street, so much relieved..

I ended up staying only for 3 nights due to some problems that I think you should be aware of. I had worked very hard during summer so I awarded myself with a nice 10 day holiday in Pattaya and Hong Kong. I chose Hard Rock Hotel over others because it had a large swimming pool and the reviews I read were rather positive. I booked one of their sea view deluxe rooms.

I was warmly welcomed at the hotel after a long flight from Europe. Check-in took a little while and they sent me my bag some 10 minutes after I arrived in my room. 

The room was rather small but OK. Modern furniture and comfortable. It did not smell very good though. As I was very tired, I had an ""expensive"" dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe and slept right after. After a good night's sleep, I decided to hit the pool which I had been looking for. This is where it all began.

More than half the pool was in shade at only 11 a.m as it is located badly. On top of it, the beds were very simple and not very comfortable and there were some competitions going on in and around the pool. They were having fun but very loud. At one corner of the pool, there is the children's pool. There were many mahy of them. I thought the clientele would be young adults and couples but it was mostly families with small children. It was extremely loud around the pool. They also start playing live music, at the pool, at 3 p.m. !!!

I was there to relax and not to have headache. I thought it would get better but next day was also the same. I wanted to go the beach but it is dirty and it is not advised to swim in it... Pattaya also turned out to be a very ""interesting"" destination too. So I left the hotel and Pattaya after 3 days.

If you have children and you are looking for fun and you have too much cash, this is the place. Otherwise there are many 4 star hotels around that are much more cheaper than Hard Rock. I am not intending to visit Pattaya or stay in Hard Rock Hotels anymore.",FlyHigh1980,Date of stay: November 2006,2,"Marmaris, Turkey",Trip type: Traveled solo,1-Value,3-Rooms,2-Location,2-Cleanliness,3-Check in / front desk,3-Service,,

After all - access to the good western comfort food at the Cafe, a 'refreshed' pool, and rock & roll themed ambiance - who can resist?

1. Booked the Deluxe Sea View room, and sent a special request for non-smoking and a bathtub. Some of the rooms have a deep bath which is awesome. I was assured (after a few inquiries via email) no problem. You can guess; on check-in my room smelled like a cigar box and there was only a shower. I asked to change but was assured there was no smoking on the 7th floor, and the only room they could change us to is facing the city, not beach.. Uh, no thanks.

I don't care so much myself, but my GF has asthma (thus the initial request). For our entire stay the place reeked of smoke, worst when we left for awhile and came back in.

2. You still can't order room-service from Hard Rock cafe - duh. Room service is not a complete menu. How hard is this to get right guys? Last visit they came up with some rubbish that they can't be sure the food can get from the restaurant to your room and still be hot - are you kidding? it's literally 200 steps from the elevator?

3. Eating the food in the Hard Rock Cafe is just about impossible. They have LOUD live bands every night until 12:30am. You simply can not pop in and have a decent meal and conversation with someone. Each time we walked in there were a handful (at most) of drunk dudes screaming back at the stage. Essential - the place was empty - because there's a mismatch of your clientele vs the headbanging rotten live (local) bands that you get to play in your cafe.

4. 1,200 baht hard rock hotel t-shirt hanging in your closet.. Need I say more?

5. Sent GF to salon to get manicure and pedicure - worst job ever, was ruined 30 min later as no UV drier - lady used a hair dryer. May as well have torn up that 800 baht.

6. Still have militant guard by elevators asking who your GF is, and still rude staff at front desk (german lady was the worst)

7. Night food menu was poor - only two deserts, pizza not offered at night, etc. 

8. In the TV menu we saw there was an 'adult' option - so late one night we chose to turn this on (you have to call the front desk and 'ask' them to turn on the porn for you - lol. I was advised there would be a 250 baht fee for this. Sure. However once on - each video also requested a 250 baht fee to watch. Are you kidding me? What's the initial fee for? Just to see your outdated and gouging prices? Please...... 

9. Tried swimming in the pool, the slides are ultra lame. The pool is divided into two sides - a shallow (and dirty) sand side, then the non-sand regular pool. A lifeguard informed me I couldn't wear my black t-shirt in the pool - hello? Most thais wear shirts to avoid the sun, and I pointed out 3 other guests that had t-shirts and hats on.. The reply was 'well they are children sir' - sorry? So a child can wear a cotton t-shirt, but an adult can't? We simply left the pool after a dip in the sand side.

10. What else; the flatscreen TV is horribly small, the windows in room are dark so at night you can't even look out the window at the city (or take photos), the amenities (shampoo / conditioner) are in hard plastic bottles - so removing the liquid is impossible (can't squeeze), the minibar is a joke, and the wifi totally erratic.

Only positive we found was the beds and pillows were comfortable. 

Essentially there is no 'rock star feeling' about the Hard Rock Pattaya. You are not treated 'like a star' - or anything close. Just another chain hotel that under delivers. My humble advice is choose the Hilton or one of the better offerings in town.",blackrice,Date of stay: September 2017,2,"New York City, New York",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,1-Value,3-Rooms,1-Service,null,null,null,,

Booked two rooms on the rock royalty floors, if available ask for a room with a balcony. From the moment you enter the gates you feel like you have arrived!! My daughters were blown away by the building and decor and you are made to feel thar extra bit special. There are a few five star hotels in Pattaya and along the strip however a hotel is just a building, the staff make the experience and honestly the staff here are friendly,  helpful and courteous at all times. Having stayed here last year it was good to see the same faces still there and shows that the hotel must be doing something right to retain staff. You get a sense of pride coming from the staff members which I loved. 
If you can, pay the extra and stay in the rock royalty rooms, you have exclusive access to the rock royalty lounge which serve snacks and drinks during the day and night as well as cocktails in the evening. The service is very personal and I found the staff going above and beyond to make our stay memorable. I had some friends over for dinner who also noted the exceptional service levels.  
The hotel has a lovely outdoor swimming pool as well as separate areas for younger children with water slides and instructors who teach rock climbing!! There is also a gym and spa area as well as steam sauna and cold plunge pool.
The hotel has a great all you can eat buffet in the evenings with food cooked fresh and ample selections of seafood. The breakfast is worth the money with a vast choice and live stations for chefs to make dishes to your requirements. We got to know a few of the servers who ensured we had a table waiting and even made sure I had the same smoothie everyday. The chefs had a particular way of cooking bacon which wasn’t to my liking but were more than happy to do a plate just for us just the way I wanted. 
I honestly was blown away by the level of service here and encourage you to pay this place a visit. The location is great right on beach road and close to the shops and markets.

The place was completely packed to the gills with Chinese and Indian families.  Tried to eat breakfast one morning and I have never see such chaos.  Kids and families running around... a messy buffet filled with disgusting looking breakfast food-like substances.  I quickly got up from my table and found another place to eat.

Room was fairly clean although the first day the clean bath towels smelled like cheese burgers.  Perhaps this was intentional in keeping with the ""Hard Rock"" theme?  In any event, it was thoroughly gross and I held my nose as I dried myself after my shower.  The next day the towels smelled normal (though they were paper thin - definitely 3-star hotel quality).

The format of the property was strange in that it is situated in the middle of the plot of land between the beach and 2nd road - meaning, to get to Beach Road one has to travel an annoying path through the bar/lounge, the pool area, and so on to reach Beach Road.  Similarly, if one wants to go the other direction to 2nd Road you have to walk a bit down the driveway of the hotel.  Not the end of the world but one would have thought they could design this better.

We finally chose Hard Rock Pattaya as we would like to have a memorable birthday for the baby and Hard Rock Pattaya has a swimming pool for children.
I booked 3 Deluxe Sea View rooms with breakfast (one room for three adults with extra persons charge including extra bed and breakfast) through Hard Rock’s hotel website in August and input a promotion code for the mango rice (I remember this code is valid for bookings in August) when I made this booking. Their reservations promised to arrange a complimentary birthday cake for celebrating my cousin’s birthday and I have also booked a 2 pounds birthday cake for celebration.
Unfortunately, the baby suffered from entrovirus 1 day before our arrival date and he and his parents were unable to take the flight. I sent an email to their reservations at night regarding this issue to see if any chance to cancel one room without charge, with the provision of doctor’s certificate if they need, but I did not get any reply from the reservations even at 13:00 on the arrival date. 
When 5 of us check-in, I explained this issue to the receptionist and asked if one room can be cancelled without penalty as courtesy as this is unexpected for all of us. The receptionist called the reservations and they said no. Indeed, I totally understand my reservations were made with discount under their promotion and so cannot be cancelled and get refund. So we kept 3 rooms and asked if the extra persons charge could be refunded as we did not need the extra bed and breakfast anymore. THE CHARGE FOR EXTRA PERSONS DOES NOT GET ANY DISCOUNT FROM THE HOTEL AND THE HOTEL but we still could not get a refund! What a ridiculous, that means we paid charges for 7 persons but only 5 staying! And for the birthday cake, I asked if we can get the money back and we also did not need to celebrate the baby’s birthday in this hotel. The receptionists nicely checked with pastry if the cake has been made or not and luckily the cake had not been prepared. HOWEVER, they could not refund the money back to us as well and the equivalent amount of money can only be used as a credit balance before check-out for other expenses in hotel.

I’m really disappointed with this hotel’s inhuman handling and policy regarding this issue. I do not have any idea how to spend the credit balance even I will check out today.

For other travellers who are interested to book this hotel, I recommend you to arrange and pay extra persons charge and cake charge at hotel instead if prepay any money to them as they would not bother to refund the money to you if you have any changes accidentally.

What’s more, the sound-proofing of the hotel rooms is very poor. I could hear all the sounds (including music, laughter, etc) that other guests and room attendant made in the corridor and other rooms with door opened. 

The Philips speaker is quite outdated that useless unless you have brought a disc or a USB with you.

The ventilation in bathroom of all rooms is very weak and some bad smell came from the toilet bowl in one of the rooms.

Regarding the room make up, I did not put their Save The Planet card on our beds in all rooms, but I found that the room attendant did not change our bed linen in one of our rooms as I could find some hair on the bed sheet after the room make up service (We all had leave tips for room attendants and they took).

And we cannot get the mango rice as the reception said the promotion has expired. How come?!

Only a special thanks to Boy who tried his best to offer us 5 glasses of complimentary drinks (local beer, soft drinks or orange juice) at their bar when he was unable to arrange the refunds.",Hayley L,Date of stay: September 2017,1,"Hong Kong, China ",Trip type: Traveled with family,1-Value,3-Location,3-Service,null,null,null,,

The hotel is large and mostly caters for everyone as it is a popular hotel sitting opposite the beach.  The staff were very friendly and were happy to help with any request.  Our rooms were not interconnecting having booked over 6 months prior but they were kind enough to rectify this in the coming days.  The rooms are large and very comfortable and modern.  We stayed in the Club Suites which had plenty of room for everyone with ocean views and a balcony.  Food and drink here is on the expensive side with a beer costing 165 baht where outside bars sell for 50 baht. It was expected to be more than outside but it caused us to seek other bars.  A burger is about $800 baht where a bar like Hooters sell for about $400-500.  Having said that the quality of food at the hard rock was very nice and good portions.  The negative experience we had were with 'çlub members'.  They appeared to be retired expats. Life guards daily saved their poolside lounges with towels regardless of whether they turned up or not.  Occasionally one of the children sat on the empty chair and were swiftly ushered off within seconds of sitting.  One incident occurred when one of these club members was attempting to swim laps in the pool.  The pool routinely has ball activities in the pool, mats, floaties, basketball etc.  A ball landed near this person during his lap swimming.  The child was returning our ball and not related.  The club member proceeded with a tirade of abuse and used offensive language with many children around.  I found it absurd that he would think that he could possibly swim laps in such a pool.  The life guards just looked on and did nothing.  The members appeared to have the attitude that the many visitors and families were spoiling their time at hotel and were in fact invading their space claiming some ownership of the area.

5) there seems to be some double standard going around where i observed only some guests being attended to at the lounge area. This is EXTREMELY unprofessional and I feel should NOT be practiced as all guests paid the same price and should be entitled to the same quality of service especially since hard rock has a level to professionalism to uphold to.
6) quality and variety in the breakfast buffet is terrible 
7) wifi services are horribly slow. Could not get any work done.
8) newspaper NOT provided in the mornings
9) although registered as 3 guests, only 2 bathing towels were supplied daily even though we have stated on day one that 3 guests will be staying here.
I SHALL NOT be returning to this hotel. 
It is NOT at all worth the price paid. We are extremely disappointed with the quality of service provided. Kindly improve your services and educate your staff on proper etiquette. Thank you.",B K,Date of stay: January 2017,1,Kl,Trip type: Traveled with family,null,null,null,null,null,null,,

Actually im writing this on behalf of my friend who has visited the hard rock Pattaya for a stay of 2 days 
Lets go to his words
""The hotel staff and everything was so amazing , good view of the city from my room and entertaining staff . 
The cost at the hard rock cafe was a bit  high and on entering an attender who seemed work there told me to pay an entry fee of 100 baht which to ticket nor stamp was given . Never mind, though its bad but not much i didnt care and never saw him again . Well i was covered for my breakfast by the tour airline and it was mouth watering but one thing was to fault 
NOTHING HALAL WAS AVAILABLE  the staff present didnt know even what that was and said they imported all the meat. Well as a muslim and religious i had to hardly satisfy myself with omelette and juice and some veggies , though my apetite and feelings told me otherwise towrds the good delicasies i had to go down with these for the 3 days 
Since if importing the meat ,then its not much  to provide halal 
Through this u guys could really get appreciated 
This sole reason prevents me from choosing next time 
Adbullah ""
Guys i request please see to it so that anyone else  including me doesnt have to go elsewhere for dining for this sole reason

When my taxi arrived on the beach side I came with 3 bags and some shirts on hangers. I asked one of the security there can you call someone to help me with my bags and he said 'NO NO NO NO' so i walked down that whole road by myself with my 3 bags and shirts. Not the best start.
The AC in the room was too cold, (even when turned up to max and the lowest power) and it made me a little sick, so just turned it off. I believe its something what needs to be looked at.

The location is perfect, the rooms are clean and nicely decorated, and the feel is definitely HardRock. However there were a lot of things that if rectified could have made our stay much better. 
Firstly everything was chargeable including the games rooms & children activities which has been 'free'(included in the hotel price) in all other hotels I have stayed in.
Secondly, most things by the pool were also for charge ie. the zorbs (inflatable ball which you can get in), the floats for people to lounge in the pool, as well as the cabanas which were usually empty besides maybe 2/3 being occupied per day despite the peak period. 
Thirdly, when we brought our own food to the pool (despite being paying hotel guests) the threatened to charge us BHT2000 for consuming our own food! In no other hotel has charged guests for eating their own food by the pool.
Lastly, the WIFI is chargeable but due to rooms not being ready and other circumstances we were given free wifi. However, the wifi signal is very bad and we had trouble connecting to it using all devices (ipad/iphone/samsung/laptop) even once they had added an additional router in some of our rooms so to use the WIFI you had to sit in the lobby, not what is expected at the Hard Rock. 
In order to make the visitor more relaxed during their holiday I would recommend increasing the price of the rooms slightly and make everything within the compound complimentary for paying hotel guests and majorly upgrading the wifi system.
Despite all it was still a good holiday but i feel the little things can go a long way in making vacations more enjoyable.",USGill,Date of stay: December 2013,4,"Perth, Australia",Trip type: Traveled with family,3-Value,4-Rooms,5-Location,4-Cleanliness,4-Service,4-Sleep Quality,,

I had a special request for our stay, which didn't really got through to the operating staff - some information might have been forgotten to be forwarded from the sales/reservations department... Well anyways, I went to the reception/concierge to find out where the problem was - and if we can get it for the next day. The staff there was very helpful, and as they didn't had any information about my request, he just asked how he may help me and what he could do for me to make me happy. Simon our hero!!!!! Really! Next day we had a nice surprise in our room :-) Thank you soo much!! He helped us with everything! Calling our taxi driver, organizing a tuk tuk, giving information about van and bus service. And even giving a tissue and cheering me up, when I had an emotional moment when saying goodbye to my boyfriend :-D All the staff was very friendly and helpful - special thanks to Simon (when we're back in Pattaya, we will pass by to say hello and bring something small for you) and the 2 guys at the poolbar - we had a fun time!
Not sure if we will visit the hard rock again for a stay - as the rooms are quite small for the price and location, as you can get better offers where the rooms are bigger and the hotel is closer to the walking street... But we did had a great stay and would recommend the place totaly in service questions. 
One recommendation we have: Please, please, please, put some signs which lead to the reception if you come along from the center (especially by feet) and don't use the main hotel entrance. It took us some minutes and we had to ask a few people to get there as there are no signs....

The pool is in a good location in Pattaya (close to major shopping centers and the beach) but we really like the pool because it offers a ‘normal’ pool plus areas for water games and a sand-bottomed shallow pool which is great for children.  
The rooms are well appointed and only complaint we had this time is the pull-out string laundry line was either broken or had been removed and there was no where in the bathroom or room to hang our bath towels or wet swimmers.  Admittedly this was a really minor problem but we thought is was surprising given the centrality of the pool to the hotel’s life. 
The room prices have always been reasonable at this hotel and we enjoy the breakfast buffet.  The restaurant food is good but you have to accept hotel prices (which is to be expected!).

The Hard Rock Hotel is just across the road from the beach, the hotel has a very large swimming pool with plenty of sun loungers, it offered various sports activities. The hotel has a gym and a sauna, and a good massage. In the evening there are different ways to eat from Asia to America food. The Hard Rock Coffee offers concerts and entertainment in the evening.
The Walking Street is easily accessible by taxi 10 baht, in the area there are plenty of Shops and also many options for dining are available, the location of the Hard Rock Hotel is perfect for me.

We had a suite room for 3 adults and 1 child, great room size and as always cleaned to the very highest standards. We had a couple of problems this trip, not major but nonetheless the reason I haven't given a 5 rating.... We know check in is 2pm and have no problem with that but on leaving Bangkok we called ahead to see what time the room would be ready, at 10am reception said the room was vacant and we could check in at 12, so we left early and arrived at midday. We made good time on our journey and upon arrival we were then told at check in that the room wasn't ready and the last guests were just checking out! We then had to wait 90 minutes for the room, I wasn't impressed and would have stayed at home and travelled later if we had known. I complained and was asked who we spoke to on reception, unfortunately I didn't take a name. The next problem was the confusion about which room the evening club package would be in, either 9th floor or ground floor, at check in we were told 2 nights would be on the ground floor, went downstairs to be told it was on the 9th floor, another night we thought let's ring reception and ask 5 minutes before leaving the room, he said 9th floor, arrived and then told ground floor again- things lacking in communication or maybe the hotel just so busy and things slipped. My final issue- we booked breakfast with the room and you can choose to eat in the club or at the buffet. We chose the buffet due to the choice and serve yourself, twice my wife went to the buffet to be asked to eat in the club as they were busy, we said no and just waited for the table. The person telling us was abrupt and almost complained that all the club guests were eating at the buffet, hey we paid a premium so can choose either!
Went to the Christmas evening buffet, it was awesome, food great and the atmosphere fantastic....free flow drinks for 3.5 hours and all for around 1400 baht a head- magnificent value for the evening.

Unfortunately hotel has a very basic problem depriving guests of decent sleep with poor airconditioning.

Whilst appreciating it is for New Years Eve  and was not a cheap holiday. Then they have got to disassemble the staging so I expect the pool will be closed for another week!!

When we arrived to the event with our prepaid tickets they denied access because we only had a picture of my girlfriends proof of vaccination not an original.  When I purchased the tickets in person they did not mention any of entry requirements.  
What we suspected and later found out to be
True as admitted by one of their staff members is they oversold this event and were looking for technicalities to deny some of their guests entry.  
They had us stand outside the event for nearly 30 minutes while 5 of the staff tried to figure out how to give me a refund.  Once they gave me a receipt for refund we were able to enter their hotel and caffe with no vaccination documents or even a temperature check.

My kids really like it and are always asking to return.
For us is a short flight (3 hours) so when we have some short holidays we go there.
When we did the check in they ask if we knew how many times we had been there and I guessed 5, then the lady told us it was our 7th time. So, because we were returning guests, they gave us 2 coupons for 2 drinks at the bar “Soul Lounge”. Well, that was strange… I wasn’t expecting anything but then she says we will have a gift and is the drinks… Really?!
Check in was quite fast and we were given room 731. We went to the room and it had a really nice view but was near the lift so we went back and asked if they had any other room available, away from the lift and they gave us the same room as in Chinese new year, room 726 (guess they checked the records :-)).
My kids went back down very fast to meet the rock agents. The rock agents cannot compliment them enough! I love them all, they are very nice and I will not name any as I may forget some and they don’t deserve to be forgotten, they really make the best of it for the kids. My kids enjoy the games and participate in most of them, they even ask to stay in the swimming pool and eat there to join the activities. My son won a “gold” Hard Rock medal in the spinning boat game and my daughter also won one “gold” Hard Rock medal at Bingo, as well as a 500 baths coupon for the spa. Adults also participate in the games and can win drinks from the pool bar. It is funny but if you want peace and quiet not your place.
On Saturdays afternoon they have a foam party for the kids, and my kids love it. At night is for adults and it finishes quite late.
On Christmas the dinner is not mandatory like in some hotels and this year it was just in the Starzs restaurant. We didn’t eat there but I had the feeling it was not as good as when they had the party near the swimming pool like 2 years ago.
We did join their Saturday dinner buffet, kids eat for free, which is quite good and convenient as my kids were joining a show the rock agents were doing for the kids. They have a lot of food choice and a whole roasted pig and the price was very reasonable.

This time, as I was staying at the end of a long trip, I thought I would pay a little bit more as I saw an Agoda add for this hotel for 125 AUD. However  Agoda charged me in USD and added a ""booking fee"" the effect of which was I paid approximately double the advertised amount. Ok so not off to a good start
 This is not the hotel's fault I guess but it put a very bad taste in my mouth to be ripped off before even arriving.
The room was of a good standard as you would expect from an internationally branded 4 star hotel. However it was not designed very well to take advantage of the location (beach front) as the beach facing window was tiny.
The pool is large and has a kids section. Love bands playing by the beach is a nice touch and in keeping with the rock theme of the hotel except a but much late at night.
Brekafast selection was slightly below par for a hotel of this size.
Staff all friendly and helpful. I was very impressed by a waitress who remembered my coffee order from the previous day. It's nice to be recognised. Also I requested a 2pm check out. Whilst the hotel could not offer that, they did permit me to use the pool and change rooms yes after check out which I really appreciated.
The beach front location is good and there are things all around. The main night life area is a bit of a walk or you can get on a songteew (open converted truck) for 10 bhat. Main shopping malls also a hike but again the 10 bhat songteew prevails.
Had I paid the advertised price I would have been very happy over all. As I paid double(ish) I am less happy about the experience.",booyeahSydney,Date of stay: January 2019,4,Sydney,Trip type: Traveled solo,null,null,null,null,null,null,,

Food was good but again for me too expensive so we went out to eat. Jasmine's on the next street was fabulous.
The Hotel is family orientated and couples. However there were also single men staying at this Hotel. I witnessed on a daily basis men brining  prostitutes to sit with them around the pool for their own entertainment and touching these girls inappropriately in front of everyone. While other paying guests could not get a sunbed!
The Hotel lifts have a sign that says Hotel guests only but security did nothing about it.
I paid a lot of money to stay in a decent Hotel as I was aware of what the Bars in Pattaya  are like and I though the Hotel would have rules regarding bringing prostitutes into the Hotel. Although there is security at the Hotel, you are never asked if you are a Guest at the Hotel or not.

When we arrive we are always greeted with a smile and a “Welcome home” and the concierge will help to take the luggage from the taxi and take to our room. Reception staff already knows us and all are very nice, friendly and helpful.
My kids love this hotel and the rock agents working here. When we arrive, they will go to look for the agents around the pool. There are some activities around the pool or in the pool every day, usually in the afternoon. There are more activities during the weekend than on week days. My 10 years old daughter loves the activities around the pool, especially the pool party on Saturday afternoon. My son is a teenager now and doesn’t appreciate it that much but still likes to play water basketball and water polo.
We need two rooms and always request connected rooms, one room with 2 queen beds and another with a king bed. This time we had also two connecting rooms (724 & 723), one of them with a balcony looking to the sea where I spent the end of the day reading and appreciating the sunset. The room (723) is a bit smaller because of the balcony but I loved it! On Saturday nights it is the pool party and it gets a little noisy in this room but it was still ok for me.
The hotel is just across the beach and at walking distance to 3D Art Paradise (3D Museum), Central Festival Shopping Center, Ripley’s Believe it or Not and some markets. To go to Walking Street you can take one songthaew, the tuk-tuk - open trucks with two rows of seats, it is only 10 bath per person.
Breakfast buffet is nice with a variety of tasty food, a noodle station, an egg station, salads, hot food, cereals, fresh fruits, yogurts, pancakes, waffles, French toast...
We had access to Kings Club but never have breakfast there as kids prefer the variety downstairs and the noodle station. We like to go to the Club at the end of the day for a drink and a snack before heading out for dinner. Staff at Kings Club is all very attentive and nice and nothing that we request is too much.
The pool is big and has different areas, from a sandy part where water is not deep to a deeper area and a kid’s pool. In the sandy area there are slides for the kids. There’s also a bar, a basketball area (in the pool) and a lot of pool chairs around the pool. We like to stay by the pool relaxing and some of the days we didn’t went out, just had lunch by the pool, and then participate in the activities that Sax presented so cheerfully. He makes things funnier and calls most of the guests by their name. 
On Saturday nights, there’s the Kids Rock Show in which kids can perform (my daughter loves it!). There’s also a show that Quest’s team will put on with the team of Hard Rock agents (Sax, Moose, Quito, and Billy).
Wifi is free and very good and there are different TV channels to choose from, as well as free movies that my kids loved.

We were greeted and the staff quickly helped us with our bags and took them into the lobby whilst I parked up. Check in was friendly and easy. We were given our rooms just before noon, even though the check in time was 2pm. The room was nicely air conditioned, had plenty of space for luggage and a decent sized bathroom. The view overlooked the hotel pool next door, which can be easily mistaken for the hotel pool.

Phuket is a much better destination, better beaches, good nightlife (not as hectic as Pattaya, but still plenty of choice and variety).

I had a connecting room with a friend and we both had the 'Kids Rock for Free' package. The rooms were lovely, very clean and had ample space to put up two travel cots (supplied by the hotel) for my twins. My 8 year old son and my friend's daughter had a great time at the pool, joining in all of the activities and playing in the Kid's Club. We hired a cabana for the day which was perfect with my twins and well worth the money. Only 400 baht for the day and this included a few soft drinks and beer (unfortunately they wouldn't let us exchange the beer for coke). For a few nights, this is a great place to go to escape from Bangkok if you are an expat. However, there were a couple of downsides:
On one night there was an extremely loud function with Thai karaoke outside near the pool and restaurant area which was right below my room. I phoned to complain and was offered a room change but this was not at all practical at 9.30pm with twin babies who were asleep and a grumpy 8 year old who couldn't sleep due to the noise. Thankfully the party stopped about 10pm. The second downside is some of the clientele at the hotel. Being located in Pattaya, there are certain types of tourists that visit the area. When relaxing in the cabana which was located by the pool bar, a group of drunk Australian men brought their prostitute 'girlfriends' into the resort and kicked up a big fuss when the pool bar attendant told them they couldn't bring their visitors into the resort. When he went off to get help, the men noticed us and loudly started talking about how I was 'octomum' as I was putting my twins into their buggy. Also, on the day we left large tour parties arrived (possibly Chinese) full of rude people who barged in front of my son and friend's daughter while they were waiting in queue for food at the buffet. At this point I couldn't wait to get out of the place. 
The hotel itself is great, the facilities fantastic and the customer service excellent. However, the clientele (and the noisy function) have put me off of returning again.",Melanie C,Date of stay: October 2012,4,Bangkok,Trip type: Traveled with family,4-Value,5-Rooms,4-Location,5-Cleanliness,4-Service,4-Sleep Quality,,

The Rooms Division Manager (I think her name was Angkana) was the shining light of our stay and made our time truly memorable - she should be acknowledged by the executive team for her outstanding customer service and for taking the initiative to ensure her guests not only enjoyed their stay but changed our minds from possibly not wanting to return to absolutely making Hard Rock Pattaya the only resort we will stay in when returning to Pattaya. Nastassia in Front Office was also very, very helpful and we were impressed by her professionalism and her great attitude; she always followed up on requests and clearly has a great future in the hospitality industry. 
I would also like to acknowledge the incredible team in the Rock Royalty lounge who looked after us so well, they were absolutely amazing with our son and that is something any parent cherishes. A truly beautiful group of young ladies (Gift was particularly friendly and helpful). 
Gina, Tipzie and the team in F&B (inc the supervisor, whose name which I cannot remember) were also so great to us and made sure we were looked after at every meal time. Also Quitto down at the gym was kind to our son who just wanted to put on some gloves and pretend to be a Muay Thai boxer! He even allowed him to pretend spar with a real Thai champion! It was a lovely experience. 
Thanks to these teams/people we left with wonderful memories of our time at Hard Rock Pattaya. Please thank these people on our behalf and let them know they are the ones who make your resort truly great and without whom we would not have had the memorable stay that we did.
The kids' area with waterslides is fantastic and our son enjoyed them a lot. I might suggest opening pool area earlier than 10am. I know it's Pattaya and nothing opens early but anyone who has had kids will know they wake up A LOT earlier than 10am and it is hard to keep them distracted till 10am when they are so excited about getting in the pool and having fun. I noticed life-guards there earlier than 10am so common sense would suggest that you turn the slides on a bit earlier (9am is a good compromise). On more than one occasion I noticed small children unaccompanied by parents in the kid's area of the pool. While I know it is not the Hard Rock's responsibility to monitor children (and it shouldn't be either) and your rules do state parents MUST supervise their children while in the pool, I would suggest your lifeguards/pool monitors having greater oversight of this area and then approaching parents who are not supervising children properly. Personally, I cannot fathom why any parent would leave their children unsupervised in a pool (of any depth - it's completely irresponsible) - it takes only seconds for children to drown (just look up secondary drowning for some horror stories!) but again, this is not the fault of Hard Rock, just a public safety warning as I am from Australia where swimming can be dangerous (because our beaches and waves can be tough - just watch 'Bondi Rescue' to see how many tourists misjudge our beaches!), all Aussies learn to swim at a young age and have a great deal of respect for the water and its dangers.
We also found charging for kids play area a bit exorbitant. The Hard Rock in Penang did not charge us and had some fantastic facilities for small and big kids available. Given the comparison between what was offered (for free) in Penang and the tiny space with very little for kids to do (at AU$24/day) Pattaya offers, we felt it was very poor value/money (we understand charging for food, however). It's ok if you're a parent who just wants someone else to parent for them while they enjoy themselves but for us, it is about entertainment for our son - it's his holiday too, after",Ben M,Date of stay: January 2018,4,,Trip type: Traveled with family,4-Value,4-Cleanliness,4-Service,null,null,null,,

This time I've met Boy at the check in counter and he was helpful and nice. Move on to the pool, my daughter and neices noticed the changes with the facilites but the staff is what makes them go back to it. Quito, Golffy, Villy, Sax have always been friendly. My sister, daughters and neices went to the Spa and was greeted by Pim who had a charming personality and gave clear explanation to the treatment. Then we spent our christmas eve by having dinner at the Starz diner, Takumi was an excellent F&B attendant. However, there are always improvements needed as the rooms are not as equiped. Things such as air con wasn't functioning well and the cabnet door of the fridge may cause injuries are details to be foucsed on to enhance it's quality.

Cool so far.  Arrived 5:50pm, 10 min early for 6pm start. Fair enough.  Still doing staff meeting at 6pm.  A bit mixed up when trying to order a drink, nobody mentioned a free drink of wine (mulled wine) was included in the buffet.  Drinks arrived.  Great long island, and draft beers cold.  After realizing wine was included, ordered 5 mulled wines.  Wine comes, abysmal.  Cannot drink.  Good for car washing though.  Made a fuss (in Thai), they changed 1 wine straightaway to a draft.  Cool.  Still ordering long island ice teas by the glass, willing to pay. At that point, a manager noticed my fuss, and immediately changed all wines to drafts.  Great service.  Christmas buffet was ok, but turkey and ham spectacular, limited desserts.  Gravy a bit of a project.  Nice show by the Father Ray Foundation, bless their hearts.  All in all? My kids loved the ambiance.  Special thanks to K. Joe (Manager) and K. Toom who went out of their way to make it right.

As we live in Bangkok Pattaya is a nice distance to come away for a long weekend and staying at the Hard Rock really makes it feel as though we are on holiday, even though we are only 2 hours from home. I only booked the hotel at about 1pm on Saturday, I rang them directly to check for availability and they sorted it out promptly.
All taxi drivers know where the hotel's so getting a taxi from the bus station is easy. If you get a shared songtaew with others doubt multiple drop-offs expect to pay 20b per person, if you have your own songtaew it'll be about 100 and takes about 10 minutes.
The staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful. They did at first require our passports for check in but as we live over here we didn't think to bring them. Although slightly worried our weekend was at an end before it started, the staff were able to easily retrieve our details from our previous stay and that was sorted.
On both visits the rooms have been nicely decorated, spacious and clean. Due to our late booking though we did have to accept two single beds, although they were massive! The beds and pillows are also very comfortable.
People say The Hard Rock Cafe is expensive. It is in comparison to Thai food but it is no more expensive than what I would pay in England for a good meal.
The pool is a great size with a good amount of Sun beds. There are lots of activities that go on throughout the day too and opportunities to win a free glass of beer (for adults) or soft drink (for kids) which goes down well with most guests. There is aPpoolside bar too and staff who walk around with menus so you don't have to leave your seat.

First the Excellent bits: The highlight of this hotel is undoubtedly its swimming pool. The beach pool is great with slides, wading pools, enough beds and some reserved wooden cabins too. 
The good bits : The hotel is in a great location bang on beach road. Close to the beach great views of the ocean. The lobby, lunge and the cafe are great for any rock music fan. Its got some great memorabilia and lovely decor.
The Not so good bits: The room was however a let down. Once you get into the room you could be in any hotel. Nothing in the room makes you feel like you are at hard rock. All the decor elements are at the public area and mainly around the lobby and the cafe (for which you don't need to checkin)
The bad bits: The room has quite sub standard facilities. We were upgraded to what they call kings club and private floor. It was very basic with some basic bathroom amenities, tiny rooms, basic furnishing. Even mosquito repellent was available for sale and not complimentary in the room. If this was kings club god save the common rock and roll fans.
Now the horrible bits: The service level of the hotel is pathetic. We had booked online through make my trip. When I turned up to checkin first we were not offered any welcome drink or and greeting. Our passport was collected and then made to wait for half an hour when I went back to enquire the lady said ""oh check in right?"" and asked her colleague to help me and walked away from the front desk area. The second lady passed this to another guy who finally started working and then said there is only one night booked for us and not two as mentioned by the booking. I showed them the receipts and he finally relented and said he will upgrade as there is no king bed with sea view in lower floors (which I had paid for so not technically an upgrade.)
The ordeal didn't end with check in ...through out our stay for the 2 nights and 3 days there was very bad housekeeping. Two nights in a row we cam back to the hotel late at night to find the room not done and the make my room sticker just hanging on the door . When my wife got upset the second night and called housekeeping the lady on the other end said its our mistake as in this hotel you have to call and ask for housekeeping and not just hang the provided sticker. Its a first I have heard something weird like tis anywhere in the world.
The service level was similar all over, at the pool, at the spa, at the shop. 
Over all a sad experience.

Found rooms. Very tiny though we stayed on the 10th floor with private key entry in the lift. Kings club rooms . Nothing kingsize but. Toilets dingy . No balcony. Small rooms.
Breakfast was extravagant. Even indian bits were added.
The pool was the highlight humongous and divided into a jacuzzi area, slides and a beach too added to one side .with a bar inside . Enjoyed the bloody mary served to me at the pool
But the reception was poor. We waited for a good half an hour to check in . They forgot to offer welcome drinks. Which they did remember later.

- You did not need a room card to use the lifts, which is a serious security issue. There was not always a security guard at the lobby.
- The light in the bathrooms was dim and shadowy - a nice atmosphere but impractical for things like putting on make-up.
- The showers only have a screen that goes less than half of the way across, so water gets over the bathroom floor. Also no shelf for putting shampoo etc in the shower so it has to go on the floor - fine for me, but if you have hip or knee problems you might struggle.
- The body lotion provided smells awful - like insect repellent (I understand that might just be my perception)
- I checked in for 5 nights under a company guarantee, where the room charges were booked to the company directly, and they still asked for a 10,000 bht upfront deposit, which is excessive. If I paid by credit card, they said it would take ""up to 20 days to reverse the charge"". I paid by cash and it was returned no problem, but not everyone carries that much cash.
- I had a facial in the spa and they asked me to pay upfront, not at the end of treatment which is not normal. In the treatment room, there is a massive bright neon ""EXIT"" sign above the door. The bed I was lying down on made me look directly up at it - so bright I could see even through closed eyes! Very distracting and not at all calming. Of course you need an exit sign - am not suggesting otherwise - but there was another bed I could lie on, I could have lay on the same bed facing away from the door, or the beds could be turned 90 degrees to face the other way. I mentioned it to the therapist but she didn't do anything. I was also disappointed with the treatment itself - when I got back to my room I still had clay in my hair and lotion clumped on my neck. My skin has been super dry since - and I got the facial for ""sensitive skin.""
- The breakfast just had very basic options and only once all week did someone come to the table during breakfast to see if I wanted tea or coffee.
- The air con in the room was a bit nosy, not good for light sleepers. The beds were really comfortable though.
- TV stopped working on the morning I checked out. There is a very small list of TV options, however they have many free movies which was awesome and a great idea to cater for such a diverse clientele.
- A woman at reception gave me vague (and as it turned out, wrong) directions to the closest supermarket.
- The woman at check-out was quite rude and abrupt. However, the guys managing the luggage / concierge were super friendly and helpful. I also have to acknowledge they helped wrap a very large painting I got at the market to make it secure for travel, which was excellent customer service for an unusual request.

I have stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas many times and love the brand so this time I thought I would try out my first Hard Rock Asia experience...
And it was AWESOME!
Firstly the service. It is impeccable. Very friendly and accommodating. Very informative and also helpful for anything local. I have stayed at a lot of hotels throughout Asia and it has become an expectation of mine that some of the service will be average. Not here.
The service here is awesome. This hotel reminded me why I love the brand so much.
BIG WIN!
Secondly, the hotel itself.
Amazing! Great foyer - always love the easy listening Rock music throughout - just makes so relaxed! Great room... not too big but really cool design with incredible ocean view and I would award them 5/5 for cleanliness! 
Very appreciative of the cleanliness, and security.
Amazing spa facility and awesome gym with a mini boxing studio and boxing ring included. The pool space is huge and aweome. In pool bar YES, in pool basketball hoop YES, awesome cabanas for rent YES, great poolside food and drinks service OF COURSE!
The hotel has a great lounge for evening drinks, it even has a beachside party deck with DJ's in the evening and on Saturdays they have the famous Hard Rock foam party!
Cannot fault this hotel for whats on offer!
Thirdly, the food and beverage.
WOW! best food I had in Pattaya was actually at the Hard Rock Pool Side outdoor Restaurant! Insalata Caprese and the Pepper Seared Tuna are to die for!
Everything about my stay was fantastic.
Highly recommended.
And I say this after staying at some other solid brand hotels too. Pullman Pattaya was nice but far away from the action, Avani Hotel is also lovely (formerly the Marriot) and I love this hotel also but for fun, sun, drinks and food - Hard Rock Wins! Plus the Hard Rock is slightly cheaper! Win, WIN, WIN!
LOVE IT. Definitely the choice if you want to party like a Rockstar, but also if you want a place for the family and kids to have fun.

They have awesome rooms with very nice interior and very spacious rooms. The location of hotel is very prompt, the one side of it faces towards the beach and the other towards the city. 
The pool was just fabulous and very big, they organise pool events for kids which was very fun to watch and for adults they organise basket ball and pool volleyball which was fun playing.  We also used the Steam bath and sauna which was very nice.
The best attraction of staying in the hotel was the foam party which for which they charge 200Baht. It was the best party. The staff was very friendly in arranging a reasonable/economical transport for transfers and tours. 
Walking street is 10mins away from hotel by tuk tuk which charges 10 bahts only or if you wanna take the view of beautiful beach in night while coming have a walk with your partner which was fun. 
However everything was positive in hotel but one thing which was disappointing which was breakfast. I understand it is an American based hotel however we being pure vegetarian it was very difficult to find anything to eat in breakfast except fruits. I feel I should have not paid for breakfast while booking the room. Being in pattaya city I understand no much of food places for vegetarians. Over and above the hotel staff saw our travel cooker and asked us not to use which was very disappointing. We have been across various hotels in Asia but till date none of the hotels denied us to use. The housekeeping dept called us and said not to use and they will help us in cooking anything but that was not possible and we need to go south pattaya restaurant Saras to have food. I want to know the reason for restricting to use the mini cooker which doesn't consumes much of their electricity. 
One last thing our welcome was good however the farewell was very disappointing. No smiles or any kind of lines of come back again or hope you enjoyed the stay which any typical hotel does. Hard rock should improve on this.

I tried to book a decent rate directly with the hotel and there was no way. Book on line never book in Thailand walking in a hotel. They even lie to you and say they can't change the rate (which they did, but still paid too much). 
Internet is expensive. Breakfast is average. The pastries were amazing to be honest. Coffee was terrible and you had to flag the servers down to give you another half cup. You can never get frustrated with Thais as they are so nice. Pancakes and waffles were cold. 
My room was cool. Shower was nice, big and had power. View was 0, a field.

This was my fourth time there and I know I will be back.
My kids love it, it is quite near to reach. We flight three hours to Bangkok, then we take a taxi to Pattaya and in less than two hours we are at Hard Rock. Taxi is THB1,500.00 but can take the bus, which is less expensive.
This was the first time after the renovation works they’ve made.
The first thing I’ve noticed is the new entry, and also the metallic decoration of the wall with guitars and animals. I just love it!
We stayed in room 726, a Deluxe Seaview and the balcony has been removed to make the room bigger. The table near the bathroom wall and by the side of the bed has been removed as well and it helps to make the room bigger also. And they put a table with 2 chairs in that area.
Under the flat screen TV the table has been extended and has a drawer. There is also a big and very convenient drawer under the place to put the luggage.
In the toilet, the bathtub has been removed and there is only a shower. It is nice, less dangerous and more spacious, but the water comes out to the bathroom floor when we shower. I like the big window/wall from the bathroom to the room that gives plenty of natural light to the bathroom if the blinders are open.
The kids club (Lil’Rock) I think is the same as before but know they also have a teens club (Tabu) that looked quite nice with things to entertain the teens like Wii, table tennis, a theater where they can make music, etc.
The Starz restaurant is different as well; all open and looks more spacious. Breakfast has some different items every day.
Dinner at Saturday night is very good and worth the price you pay. And kids bellow 12 years eat for free.
Now, there’s also a Pizzeria. We didn’t eat there, mainly because the choice of pasta is not much and they don’t have all kids’ favorite pasta: spaghetti Bolognese. So here’s a suggestion to improve.
The chairs by the pool were always occupied and I don’t know if there is less chairs or the hotel was busier this time.
I felt that there were less activities promoted by the rock agents than before, but, as always, the rock agents know how to entertain the kids and make the activities more fun. My son arrives at Hard Rock and loves to find the rock agents that always tell him “Welcome home!”

She was firendly and helpfull. I told her it was my daugthers 8th Birthday tomorrow and she said their will be a small surprise for her at breakfast. So when we came to breakfast the next day the staff brought her a small Birthday cake and they all were loudly singing for her. My daughter loved it and I really appreciate the kindness from the hotel for this. The days in the hotel we spend the most at the big pool. There are lots of activities for the kids wich they enjoyed al lot. I personally think that the pool and the pool staff are the main attraction for the hotel. Pool guys were very friendly and helpfull for the kids.They always had time to have a chat or play with the kids while on the otherside they always put safety first. My special thanks goes to Tiger and Quito. These guys are simply amazing. Nothing was to much for them to make the kids and other customers feel good and had a good time. My two daughters Anya and Sabina loved them. If the management is reading this I should say give these guys a raise, they deserve it!! Breakfast was good and many choice. Even on crowdy times food was refilled quickly. Restaurant staff also very friendly and helpfull. My only complain is about housekeeping. There is a safe in the room where I put my belongings and cash, but I always keep some small change in coins on the table in the room. Before housekeeping came I had a lot of coins spread over the table and when they finished clean the room all coins were gone. I informed the reception about it and the guy looked annoyed that I complained. So he said to me that probably the housekeeping thought it was a tip!!! After 18 years living in Thailand and visited many hotels this is the first time that this happened to me. He told me to check on this, but I never heard anything. Furthermore the next day I left the room at 09;30 and came back 13:30 the room was still not cleaned allthough I had the make up room sign outside.... An other day when I was relaxing with my kids after breakfast in the room with my kids housekeeping was nocking on my door every 5 minutes to clean the room and they looked angry that I was still in the room. As I speak and understand Thai fluently and also my daughters we heard how they were speaking in very rude and bad language about us. So all together It was a great stay at the HRH and we really enjoyed our stay and my daughters cant wait to go back, but they should do something about the housekeeping...",Nicolaasvan,Date of stay: December 2013,4,"Bangkok, Thailand ",Trip type: Traveled with family,3-Value,3-Rooms,3-Location,3-Cleanliness,3-Service,5-Sleep Quality,,

For example, they offer two priced options to the airport but only offer the most expensive option until you decide it's too expensive and walk away. They were also not very good at arranging trips such as tickets to the Tiffany show where I wanted center VIP seats and was willing to go at anytime during my two week stay but they didn't seem very efficient in checking availability. They were just trying to get me any seat available and not trying to get what I wanted. They were also trying to force private trips to places rather than the offering group options which are cheaper.

At that time I checked in with Korean staff she was very nice to help us. So I spent great time with my husband and we decided to come back to stay again. I went here just few days weeks ago WITH MY VERY LITTLE BABY ONLY BORN IN 80DAYS. It was extremely disappointed. When I checked in the staff keep smiling say kindly BUT SHE DID NOT LISTEN ME AT ALL. I feel she never listens to me what I request. I only need bathtub but she gave me room without bathtub. When I went down to change the room she said they only have a bathtub in suits room. I understand and we pay more and upgrade to suits. And even she escorted to the room with my baby in baby car. She knows I have a baby. BUT SHE GAVE ME SMOKING ROOM. How come she can give us smoking room. When I checked in I already tell her I need non smoking. I didn't know smoking room when I just got that room but after I can smell from hallway and come to my room then I feel weird and I realized when I checked elevator there is smoking sign in 10 floor. Just before I checked out. Actually I believe her because we pay extra for the suits. Now I regret so much Better not believe her. And I also requested baby-cot since I checked in she said she will inform to bring us soon but I wait until 5pm still didn't come call them. They said will send soon. Around 10pm still didn't come WE REQUEST 3TIME THAN THEY BRING US. I never imagined 4star hotel do like this. And about wifi also since we checked in she never explain us how can use or where is wifi paper. I have to call again and ask them. I only stayed one night but made us everything annoying. When I checked out she help us and smiling again. It made us more angry. This time seems like she tried to ignore us with smile.  Her name is ANN. She told me she is manager. I still don't understand how came manager do service like this. I seriously don't want to go hardrock hotel again because of her.

It is about a 25 minute walk up to Walking street but you might want to catch a cab when it is hot... 
Firstly the staff here are amoungt the best I have ever experienced. Really, you cannot fault them! They are all very friendly, accomodating and very energetic. Nothing is too hard or too much for these guys. No matter what time of day, they will greet you with a big smile and hello and they all speak very good English. 
The rooms are good too, the decor is a little dated but I believe they are in the middle of upgrading. They have plasma's, MP3 player's, mini bar etc, We had a great balcony view of the ocean with sunsets every night. However, the bathroom's are not very private... The doors are a little unusual and they have a pull together window/mirror over looking the bed and the bath is quite old with rough tiles. You really wouldn't want to use this as a bath. There wasn't much storage space in here either.
The food is good at Hard Rock too. The breakfast is very tasty with a large variety of pastries, cereals, cold cuts and hot meals. It can get very crowded the later you go so best to get in early. Unfortunatley for us, our travel agent 'forgot' to include breakfast in our package and we had to pay the extra but it was well worth it. The room service is also good, a large menu with a good variety of choices, their pizza's are sensational! They do a buffet dinner every weekend and the Hard Rock cafe is also good if you are after traditional American. I recommend trying their chicken bites and one of the salads. 
The pool is what makes Hard Rock thou. It is massive!!! And parts of it are shaded so no matter how hot it gets, the pool always stays cool and refreshing. They also have a man made beach and music playing. The staff host daily entertainment for the little kids (and big kids) so their is always something to do rather then just sunbake (like joining in the YMCA dance!).

Since our arrival until our departure, everyone is so friendly and helpful! Coming back so many times, we know most of the rock agents like Willy, Sax, Quito and the ones we don’t remember the name now but still love them for making our stay always enjoyable.
Even the staff we don’t know like Patchy at Rock Royalty and others we know like Somo, Ana always have a smile and a friendly word and will go out of their way to help when needed (like when my son was sick).
The hotel location is great! Just across the road from the beach, a short walk to Central Festival, bars, restaurants, and shops. Usually we spend most of the time enjoying the hotel facilities as everything you need you can find there.
We stayed at rooms 823 & 824, two connecting rooms, very spacious and very clean, including the carpet! The balcony has a wonderful view, facing the sea where I can get my daily dose of Vitamin Sea just by staying there! It was particularly nice this year as the weather was colder than usual.
Toilet is big and clean with the amenities we needed. I read some comments about no toothbrush, but I forgot mine and they brought me one when I requested.
My daughter loves the foam party and the activities the rock agents carry on all day around the pool. My son especially enjoys the water basketball. 
They enjoy to stay at the hotel and just eat there by the pool, the charcoal burger is their favorite! Fajitas at hard Rock Cafe are another favorite!
We went to the dinner buffet on one of the days and the food is quite nice with reasonable price, and my kids (aged 12 to 18 years) only paid 50%.
Well, it was a great holiday and we can’t wait to go back again! 
I want to add a note regarding my friend (staying at room 602) that arrived on the day of her birthday but during the early morning and at the end of the day a small cake was delivered to the room.

From the foyer to the pool deck and in between the staff were always helpful and enthusiastic and nothing was too much trouble. The rooms were spacious, well presented and comfortable but be warned that if you have a room that faces the pool it will be noisy on a Saturday night due to the pool party that happens every Saturday. There is a great selection of food at breakfast but it does tend to get busy so best get in early. The pool is massive and well set out with a kids play area and semi swim up bar. Lifeguards are on hand to supervise and rescue should any swimmers get into trouble and the Hard Rock cafe has a good position overlooking the beach.

Being across the beach, the views were absolutley stunning-and with the brilliant band they had playing at the bar each night made it even more delightful.
The staff were very friendly, welcoming and helpful. Service and enquiries were responded to fairly quickly. 
The pool facilities were also great- and kept the kids pretty preoccupied. 
The morning buffet had some variety; which was nice to wake up to. 
The bubble party they had was also quite entertaining. They had one for kids/family- it was very well organised. Later on in the night they had ine for the adults too- along with a  dj; it was pretty fun. Id recommend booking one of the huts. 
We utlised the nanny service they offered for our kids and were quite pleased. Alongside that, the rooms were pretty well kept.

What finally convinced me was a promotion that made the HRH’s nightly rate cheaper than my previous digs in the region. And I’m shocked to report that I really, really enjoyed my stay there.
Firstly, the newly renovated rooms are tasteful, functional and blessedly devoid of photographs of rock legends (yawn). The service was awesome, my ice seemingly delivered as I uttered the word. And room service did a damn good and affordable spicy Som Tum when I wasn’t in the mood to explore my beloved Thai food carts. 
Another thing: If I had kids there’s no other place I’d stay, given the myriad ways they keep little ones happy and out of their parents’ hair - from rock climbing to watersports to magic displays and dance-offs. 
I’ll confess I’m a fussy traveler and there were also many small things that impressed me, like the one big easy-glide drawer in each room that holds everything you brought (instead of the usual small drawers that I never use). Or the “Dial-0 Hotline” that connects you with any service by dialing zero. Plus, when I asked to open the locked window of my upper-story room to get some fresh air, they upgraded me to a balcony room. Bam! I'm sold. :)
Okay, there was a Saturday night when the music at the pool party kept me awake till 1AM, but that’s the same at any hotel geared toward a younger crowd.

However, they reduce the number of rooms with balconies in order to make the rooms bigger. This is disappointing as I enjoy sitting in the balcony and enjoy the view over Gulf. I always book sea view room and always getin a room with view over the pool and the gulf. This time, however, they gave me a room with no balcony and had side view of the sea. I protested, but they could not provide another room with balcony with pool and sea view the first day. This was mainly because they have much less rooms with balconies now. I was moved the next day with room with balcony and sea view although it was smoking room but it did not have any smoke smell.

We had a nice check-in experience, but we didn't get the king bed as requested. Instead, we were stuck with two smaller beds and a little discomfort for a couple. We opted for the ""Kings Club"" room, and it was definitely worth the upgrade fee. We had a balcony, entrance to the Kings Club Lounge and many other amenities included.  Wifi is slow, and requires a login every time you want to connect to the internet. The food and drinks at this hotel were extremely expensive for the Pattaya area, and nothing exciting in comparison. The pool area is large, but the VIP cabanas are in the shade all day, and there are not nearly enough lounge chairs for people who want to lay by the poolside and relax. People acted like vultures, and play childish games reserving lounge chairs.  We found ourselves without lounge chairs more than once. Another complaint that I have is that the staff could not seem to understand that the names on the two separate rooms that were booked were switched. During check in they gave my brother my room and me his room. We tried numerous times to explain it, but the staff did not understand at all.  The level of English-language needs to improve to deal with foreign visitors. Charging anything to the room was a complete hassle, and we had to sit and figure everything out together during our departure. What a pain! We decided not to stay our entire time in Pattaya (an additional 6 days) at this hotel, and took our business elsewhere - right down the street to an even more centrally located hotel for less than what we paid at the Hard Rock. My feelings are very mixed, and I couldn't recommend this hotel.

Getting to the hotel from Bangkok was easy although traffic was heavy on this day.  I arrived about 4:00PM and check in was easy.  The hotel staff was pleasant and helpful. I went to my room and found everything in working order.  There was a sage big enough for my laptop.  The room included 2 bottles of water that was replaced everyday.  The wifi was fast but you could only use 2 devices on there system at any given time.
The bathroom was a little small but it was functional.  There was a window that overlooked the bedroom which was interesting.  Fortunately it had a window shade that you could close.  There was a walk in shower.  It didn't have a door, so prepare for the bathroom floor to be a little wet after your shower.
I had a seaview and the view of Pattaya and the sea was nice.  The room had a sofa enough power outlets for me.  Fortunately I brought my power adapter because not all the outlets for of the universal type.  The bed and pillows were very comfortable.  I was able to turn the air conditioning on and off, but couldn't seem to adjust the temperature.  Luckily it was adjusted to a temperature that wasn't too cold, but I did have to turn it off sometimes to be comfortable in the room.  Like most Thailand TV's, the choice of English stations is poor.  You if you like to keep up with the news, use the internet.
The location of this hotel is great.  It is right across the street from the beach.  The pool seemed great and always had a lot of people using it.  There were a lot of kids splashing around, but I never heard them from my room.  The hotel is very quiet at night.
Getting to other parts of Pattaya was easy.  Once you exit the hotel, you could always find a baht bus or taxi to take you wherever you wanted to go.  There was  tour desk on the properties to help you make travel arrangements.  They didn't seem to have a lot of brochures so I would suggest being a little prepared for what you want to do.
Sadly I never went to the hard rock bars.  I wish I had, but I do know they close by 1AM, and most other places in Pattaya close a lot later.  There were security guards and both entrances to the hotel which was nice.  My room rate did include breakfast and I ate there several times.  The place was full, but I was always able to get a table inside.  And there was always plenty of room outside.  The food was good and plentiful.  I always enjoyed what I ate.

The pool is excellent and offers a relaxing & fun atmosphere. Staff were most friendly!
If you can, fork out for a Kings Club room as the snacks, pressing, drinks & happy hour can be a nice addition. I don't think the rooms were especially larger (35sq) though. Just be aware a double queen room is actually 2  double beds. We were accommodated extremely well however with a King and the day bed was made up perfectly to fit Master 5!
A negative on the place is that the food is average. Not bad - just boring. I've had better breakfast buffets but I have definitely had worse. Same goes for the actual Hard Rock Cafe.

We booked our room for the weekend (Friday and Saturday night).  We are a family with 2 young kids, so the pool and kids club house were essential and part of our stay.  Our hotel package included a few hours of kids club.  The kids club never opened over the weekend.  The reason we were told was because it was Valentines Day on Friday and because of the concert that didn't start until the evening on Saturday.  Of course, this was never advertised when we book our rooms that stated we would have this.
The pool is great, but you are constantly harassed to buy food and drinks from the staff.  We had just arrived and our room wasn't ready, so we camped out at the pool.  We still had several of our things and several staff stared at us because we had the cooler with us that we used in the car.  My friends kid wasn't feeling good the next morning so he got her some waters from the seven eleven and he got a lecture from a staff member about not bringing in outside drinks.  Really?  The child wasn't feeling well.
The life guard all wear shoes and socks while on the life guard stand.  I've never known a life guard that thought shoes and socks made them better swimmers when rescuing children from drowning.  They have whistles and blow them across the pool to the people who mistakenly think that the rafts are for use for everyone.  It is humiliating and rude.  Put someone there to inform people, but don't blow a whistle at them.  Although, what were those people thinking.  Nothing is free at the Hard Rock.

I think the overall staff at this hotel is very well trained.  They were all friendly, and eager to assist.  The buffet for breakfast was pretty good too.  If I were to stay there again, I would include the breakfast option because of the convenience and it was comparable in quality/selections to the price I paid - so worth it if you just want an easy breakfast option.
Rooms can fill up fast during high travel periods, and we didn't get a room with a King or Queen bed, but they offered to make the two twin beds into one.  We opted not to do that, and the bed size for the twin wasn't that bad!  We ended up sleeping in one bed.  The only difference may have been a couch or something in the single bed room?  We would have liked that because we tend to be in the room more at certain periods of the day, and having a couch would have been nicer to relax on.
This was for a stay on their Rock Royalty floor level (there are two floors 9th and 10th) and I would recommend that because of the access to the lounge on the 9th floor.

Guest Services Manager Wanrudee (aka Ann) was once again magnificent in making me feel welcome as were the countless staff I have known for so many years. It is truly my second home. Because it’s my second home I feel I can comment on changes. This time, for the first time, I cannot lie down on a lounger on the right-hand side of the pool (looking from the hotel). A huge part of the pool area was almost totally unused. On the other parts, people were increasingly crammed together like a 3-star hotel on the Costa del Sol.  Why .. why replace the loungers with white plastic tables .. ? Also, I was there for 9 days and not once did I see anyone use a cabana. There is something seriously wrong when a large part of your property goes unused like this. Hope these comments are helpful. I am not the only one who saw this.. another review from January 2020 said:
“Lots of space near the large pool taken up by cabanas, which no one uses therefore not enough sun beds for hotel guests. All sun beds occupied by 10.30am leaving guests wandering around with towels and nothing else.”
I am sure I will be back again despite the backward steps the hotel has recently taken because the staff are great.
A final note, I should say that my stay was during this unfortunate coronavirus outbreak and some visitors may find attitudes to personal hygiene hard to understand in people from other cultures. When a Chinese guest let loose an enormous sneeze across the breakfast buffet food with no attempt to cover it I really thought I should have stayed at home.",Digital_Nomad2013,Date of stay: February 2020,4,Poole,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,,

I deliberately booked for 2 people.  Paid Qantas for 2 people yet they keeped charging 900 baht for a second person to be in the room.  This is what is regarded in Australia as misleading and deceptive conduct.

The value for the quality of the property, the amenities, and service is absolutely outstanding. It's not a 5 star hotel but I certainly had a 5 star experience here. 
After I checked in and saw my room (it was a standard, decent 3 star hotel room...but one that I live in 30 weeks a year for my job) I decided I wanted something better and they offered me an upgrade to the King's Suite at a price I couldn't refuse. And the room was absolutely spectacular!
It had one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in, a huge bathroom with a separate shower and giant tub, a big couch, and two balconies overlooking the sea. Even if you don't get a suite, make sure you get a room on the south side of the building so you have a view of Pattay City and the bay. And not all rooms have balconies so request that if you like having one.
Being the premier room in the hotel, it obviously had access to the King's Club lounge, but they have many other rooms with these privileges, and I highly recommend the upgrade. It includes breakfast in the morning and hot food and cocktails in the evening. I felt like we ate and drank enough to otherwise pay for the upgrade itself. You also got what amounted to a private front desk and concierge service. The service the staff up there provided was outstanding.
The pool at the Hard Rock was absolutely amazing! It's massive, to begin with. It has a swim up bar, a sandy area, a basketball hoop, and plenty of covered, cushioned lounge chairs to relax in. The pool staff also gets involved and organizes games and activities such as volleyball, water polo, basketball and many other fun things you can participate in. I found myself spending most of my afternoons at the pool before going out to the crazy nightlife of Pattaya.
The staff at the Hard Rock are all very well trained and provide excellent service. I never had a bad experience with one of them. They were all very friendly and eager to help in any way you needed. They made you feel like you were at home.
The location of the hotel is also perfect. It's about a 15 minute walk or 5 minute tuk tuk ride to walking street, but far enough away from all of the noise. There's also plenty of food options and shopping right nearby on Beach St. and on 2nd Rd.
One other thing I like to mention about hotels in foreign countries is the wifi...it was flawless here. Super fast and immediate connections in all areas of the property. You logged in once and your device was good for the rest of your stay. You didn't have to log in every day or every time you moved to a different area. When you came back to the hotel after going out, it would automatically connect as soon as you stepped foot on the property. This was definitely the best wifi I encountered anywhere on my month-long trip to Asia.
I had such a good time here that I extended my room for a few more nights before heading over to Phuket. When I come back to Pattaya, I will definitely stay at the Hard Rock again.
One piece of advice though: don't exchange money in the hotel...their rates are TERRIBLE compared to what you get on the street.",Jim K,Date of stay: December 2015,5,"Los Angeles, California",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,5-Location,5-Cleanliness,5-Service,null,null,null,,

It is bang on the beach road, with Central Festival Mall, just 850mtr. You can easily get tuk tuk right from the outside & royal garden plaza, walking street etc. are just a short drive away. Each floor is beautifully decorated. The spread at the buffet breakfast is vast and food tasted amazing on all the 3 days. It has a huge pool with separate Jacuzzi section in between & a swim up bar too. It also has steam, sauna & gym facilities which are upto the mark. The best part is it kids pool which is one of the biggest kids pool I have ever seen. It has an artificial beach by the side with beach beds. Beautiful beach huts are available for a small rental where you can laze around for hours, seeing your children play, sipping your drink, taking a dip in the pool & relaxing on the lounge beds. There are various slides in the kids pool which adds to the fun. It has kids club too. This comes at a very reasonable rental. We had an appointment for Onsen bath & spa. It was treatment for 5hours. We left our 4yr son at the kids centre where he had so many options to play, even beds if he felt like dozing off & they also offered him a meal, all this at a very small price. At the end of it, when we came to take back our son, he was so indulged & happy that he wanted to stay back  for some more time. One more thing I would like to mention is that we used their baby sitting service as well. Initially I was a bit skeptical whether we should leave our 4yr son with baby sitter alone in the hotel. But we were assured that the baby sitter is not someone who comes from outside.Instead, she would be a senior inhouse staff from the hotel. That built our confidence more. We had to go for partying & had called the baby sitter at 11pm for 3hrs. We had thought that we will make our child sleep early so that the babysitter just has to supervise the sleeping baby. But unfortunately our son was fully awake when the baby sitter came. Within minutes the baby sitter made friends with our son & soon they were playing together with the toys. We had instructed her to make him sleep when it is 12:30at night and dim all the lights. When we came back at 2am, the lights were dim, our son was sleeping & the baby sitter was sitting right next to him. She informed us that he slept on time & was a very good child & told us what conversations he was doing with her. We were so satisfied & happy that our son was in very good hands. Her name was Nam, & I extend my special thanks to her for taking such good care of my son.
Overall it is one of the best properties I have stayed at with family. Highly recommended for travellers with family as there is so much to do inside the property itself for the kids.

This property is in a good location, smack in the middle of the ""happening"" Pattaya, with beach just across the road.
Open air car park is free and safe with 24-hrs guard. Property is a little old & dated but rooms were updated with all the modern mod-con. I booked the Deluxe Sea View room with the 10th Anniversary package, that comes with free wifi and breakfast and unlimited on-demand pay movie.
Room size is OK, sound-proofing good, balcony has 2 deck chair and a small table as well as cloth-drying rack. My room is directly above the pool where I saw lots of programs throughout the 3 days I was there, both for adults & kids. Even though music and games were being played just below my window, I didn't hear any noise if I closed the balcony window. Block out curtain really block out sun if needed. Bathroom has no tub.

Bed quality was OK. Pillows were too soft for my liking and I requested for firmer ones, delivered fast upon request. Room service was fast and good. Breakfast with good selection.
What really upset me is the wifi connection. It's really bad......so bad I requested 7 passwords which they promised will be better than the previous ones, but sadly not. I ended up paying using my data roam and teether through my phone. The signal was non-existence in bathroom or balcony, even in room, you can probably read some mails without attachment It's hovering between 30kb/s so web-surfing is out of the question.
It's within walking to most F&B joint, bars & pubs, shopping mall etc. Location is great for first time visitor. 
The staff at HRP are great fun young people. Check-in staff were fast (the fastest check in experience I had), concierge helpful, breakfast wait staff were fantastic and remembered my preferred seating and drink by the second day which was really impressive and I see pool attendants organizing fun programs. 
I would stay in the hotel again even though I didn't give it an all-star rating. I hope the management gets to read this and improve on the weakness of their wifi and recognize their staff for the effort they have made to guest like me. If you must use fast internet, I would suggest buying a data card from airport or mobile shop and just bite the bullet and pay a little more and I believe you'll enjoy this hotel as much as I did.

My wife took advantage of the gym and she was very happy with the facility and instructor. We didn't use the Spa or some other amenities so I can't comment. We had free access to a business suite that I didn't actually use but it would have been ideal for meetings or small conferences etc. The pool was awesome and there's always something going on in that general area. The food choices are limited to the Hard Rock Cafe Burgers/Pizza etc and a few extra dishes but it's a bit light on for variety and I think it's just a little expensive for what it is.

Had heard a lot about this property from friends and relatives...  Specially about their in-house activities... But unfortunately there didn't seem much of them around when I stayed here, except for the 'foam party' that's organized every Saturday... And this too seemed kind of dead coz of lack of participation.
I've had my share of embarrassment when a lady staff knocked once at my door and without cross checking opened the room door with her service key and stepped in for cleaning! Come on guys! This is not done! Have you heard of something called privacy!!!???!!!
The breakfast is elaborate, but being a pure vegetarian my choices were pretty limited. Considering the number of Indians putting up here, I think they need to tweak their menu. And guys please change the vegetarian menu! Its monotonous seeing the same stuff day after day!
The new year's eve gala dinner and party was compulsory and they charged a fortune for the same, but again very very limited vegetarian options and frankly the so called 'party' wasn't up to Hard Rock standards! It actually seems like a waste of money and time!
The program could have been much more interesting and better had they added guest participation and variety rather than the band of 3 artists performing and hopelessly trying to entertain the guests all night long!
A sheer waste of new years eve and money. Frankly, the price I paid for my stay and the gala dinner were exorbitant, I did have some expectations, but now they all seem a waste and I go back longing for more and feeling cheated! I still can't figure out why I paid so much to put up here!
The staff is no doubt good but considering the brand and the tariff I feel they need to roll in English speaking staff. Currently the room intercom is directed to an English speaking operator who tries to sort things for u, but at the end of it all, one has to deal with non English speaking staff! Is this hard rock standard?
My verdict: overly priced property, not worth the money. Some might not agree, but considering the new year's package one IS left longing for more. My experience wasn't too good. Neither the property nor the event was worth the price!",Rahul Agarwal,Date of stay: December 2013,3,"Kanpur, India",Trip type: Traveled with family,2-Value,3-Rooms,4-Location,4-Cleanliness,4-Service,4-Sleep Quality,,

Our room was supposedly city view but it was more overlooking the roof and the side of another hotel but luckily we didn’t spend a lot of time in the room or on the balcony during this part of our trip.
We were bed and breakfast which suited us fine, a word of caution the restaurant gets packed and it can be a bit of a fight for food so take a table outside near the pizzeria for a quieter experience.
Undoubtedly the main feature of the hotel is the pool which is great for all ages and the music and the staff only add to the excellent atmosphere. Also you can get draught or canned beers and the food menu if decent as well. We liked the fact that when joined by friends there were also tables and chairs poolside to sit at and play cards, drink and chat. If you need supplies head out through the lobby and the car park and there is a family mart and 7/11 right across the road so no need to walk down the busy beach road.

The New Year's Eve party started off well with a great buffet but went pretty much downhill after that, the 'Red Balloons' band dominated the stage and to be frank was pretty bad (much better bands in the town), they played a lot of pop along with the rock and to my disappointment at one point were even playing that annoying Brazilian singalong pop song at which point we left and went into town. 
My view is that it is a hotel that tries to please everybody but as a result cannot legitimately call itself a Hard Rock hotel. It should be renamed the Pop Hotel. It's a more of a family / package tour hotel than a Rock Hotel. Although, maybe I misunderstand the brand or had too
high expectations.
We went for the cheapest room 'city view' was very average and with a total bill of around 1k
Euro for 5 days including party tickets there is much better value elsewhere even at New Year. Not possible to request a balcony when reserving only when checking in so when we arrived to have a balcony we had to take a twin vs double and it was a smoking room at one of the lowest floors with a view on the restaurant roof.

 My personal favourite was the health and fitness facilities.A decent gym session followed by a sauna,steam room and then the ice cold plunge pool, and I was feeling a little less guilty from all those mango shakes and fries.

From the moment i arrived at the hotel, the bellmans greeted and as always, very friendly and rock! At the front desk, me and boyfriend were lucky enough to have Gislene (if i saw her nametag correct) to help us with c/i. At first, she gave us the last room, but since i dont really like to be on the last room, i didnt even go in and decided to go down and once again she handled me. I got ""upgraded"" to the 10th floor. I know it's quite annoying to change this at that at the opera system cause i also worked in hotels before so i know how she would feel! Anyways, each time i passed by the front desk, she would smile and even talk to us again.. Hope she will be promoted soon cause she has lots of potential.. *credits to her*
Bbf was fine, it has quite big range of food to choose. Pool was good and associates even better. Location is good. i dont really have anything else to comment about cause i enjoyed my stay and will definitely be back soon and look for her again!

I must say that I liked this place… but there were a few points that does not allow me to give this a full 5 star rating… hence the 4 point rating of my review.
So, here it is:
POSITIVE POINTS:
+ As usual, the Hard Rock franchise give you the feel of being among the famous… and in Pattaya it does not disappoint. 
+ Staff (with the exception of a couple of people) are extremely friendly, helpful and simply very pleasant.
+ The hotel is clean in every area… so a huge thumbs up to the staff taking care of this.
+ Room with a view over the sea is fantastic... NICE sunset from the 8th Floor.
+ Pool area is pleasant, safe and well taken care of. Nice array of activity… despite not having so many guests due to COVID.
+ Hard Rock Café at the bottom end of the property is very pleasant… and I appreciate the fact that (even though it goes into the night) you cannot hear it in the room.
+ Central location… easy walking distance to many options of shopping / restaurants / entertainment / across the street from the beach… etc.
SO-SO POINTS:
+/- Room is rather small, yet still comfortable.
+/- I (personally) do not understand the need for a STEP UP to get into the bathroom. Almost tripped and fell late at night, when needing to use the toilet. This step into the bathroom makes no sense at all.
+/- Breakfast was JUST OK… I could not understand why there was NO cheese on none of the days that I was there. Juices… not fresh – something like the ones you buy at the supermarket.
NEGATIVE POINTS:
- WHY… WHY… WHY do certain employees give me the sensation that they are trying to make money on the side? I asked for a taxi to the local hospital (for COVID testing before my flight back). It took about 15 minutes for the taxi to arrive… and cost me 150 Bhat. It is literally 500 meters away… simply worth 35 Baht. SURELY some sort of “system” to favour their friends at a commission. 
- Asked for a taxi to the Airport… wanted me to pay 2500 Bhat??? I came from Bangkok, and paid 1500. When I argued with him that 2500 is not an option… he came down to 1500 – which was what I paid… but the sensation I got was that they run a scheme to get the most money out of tourists.
- Last point on the negative side… is the price for the night. I am sure that I paid too much, and despite liking the stay here, I felt that it is overpriced.
SUMMING UP:
Maybe next time, I will stay on the other beach... and not on this side. The negative points really left a bad taste in my mouth.",Trave1Bandit,Date of stay: December 2021,4,"Maia, Portugal",null,4-Rooms,4-Location,3-Service,null,null,null,,

The staff are friendly and they would assist in anything to the best of their abilities. What I like is also that if you ever need some recommendations on where is go to explore in Pattaya, they would be more that happy to suggest some of the famous places to visit.
Furthermore, you can also rent a guitar with a deposit of 10,000 baht.
Location wise, I would say it's conveniently located in an area with convenience stores (7-11 and FamilyMart) just 5 minutes away from the front entrance and malls and food located about 5 to 10 minutes walking distance away from the back exit of the hotel (Near the Café/ Pool). The back exit is also near a beach where one can chill or engage in water activities. If you intend to travel further down from the hotel, there is also a mode of transport called Song Thaew (which is a vehicle almost like a truck) acting like the buses. SongThaew would usually goes in a fixed route, charging 10 baht per person, so it's very reasonable.
The security measures taken were highly regarded to ensure the safety of the guests. The room I stayed in was their Deluxe City View Room and has all the basic amenities of a hotel room, with their Rock Spa bathroom amenities, which I appreciate alot. The bed is comfortable and allows one to have a good night's rest. On the down side, the website stated that from their Deluxe City View Room, they offer 'a balcony with views over the hotel gardens and the city'.

Check in was effortless and straight up to your room.
Food at hotel was nice but can get cheaper and same quality elsewhere.
Drink little overpriced also.
However breakfast is worth getting up for even with a hangover.
A family hotel for sure and kids entertained by pool, can be annoying if you have hangover but it's not that sort of hotel.
Was disappointed that the hotel shop did not do the traditional hard rock t-shirt as it would have been cool to get one, they do have many other fancy options but no traditional ones, shame.

The room is smallish but has recently been refurbished and updated from our last stay 2 yrs ago. The addition of new sofa and LCD TV and repaint has really increased the comfort of the room and is good to see that management recognise that rooms have to be looked after. The bathroom remains small, but is fully functionally, but only comes with a shower. The views from deluxe rooms over Pattaya bay are amazing. The pool is possibly the biggest selling point of this hotel, but the activities are bit over zealous. By the pool there is constant rock music played - noisy but not overpowering and to be expected at the HardRock and actually makes drinks at the pool bar a bit more fun, but the kids and adult activities never give you a break to relax. The constant games and game co-ordinator with his microphone shouting ecouragement for all to hear slowly wear you down. The children running around shouting and screaming is one thing but the microphone drowns out their noise, then along comes pool volleyball with a comentary , then comes dancing and sign alongs, then more childrens games, and so on and so on. You never get a chance to relax and just read your book and with the activities always taking place in the pool , if you want to go for a relaxing swim you can't in large areas due to the games taking place. The Hard Rock is meant to be a fun hotel, but I think they need to find a happy compromise between those who want to play all day and those who want to relax - maybe a couple of hours in the early afternoon and then finish??

the location of the hotel is very good with the hotel on Second Road and on beach road.
The hotel has a beautiful swimming pool and on saturday evening a pool party is given with foam.
security at night is very good and i like the old security guard at the elevator.
I love the free movie selection in the room.
The breakfast buffet is fine for Asian and English guests, but for a more western breakfast the choice is moderate with mostly little sandwich and not much to pot on your sandwich like ham or cheese. 
The cleaning of the rooms can be better and especially the light switches the phone and the remote control of the television are very dirty. This is something you see worldwide in hotels. 
what really bothered me was the high deposit of 2000 baht a night that is asked.
especially if you stay several nights the deposit is high. a limit should be set up to a maximum of 5000 baht for example. 
for this I stay at Novotel Ploenchit Bangkok and the doposit was 3000 for three nights.
Novotel is part of the Accor group. The largest hotel company in the world.

But due to family crisis, spouse had to fly out just before coming to Pattaya - leaving me with 2 kids in tow to take care of (and entertain) - so expecting a fun-filled Asian HR hotel as the one in Bali that will keep them occupied.  

Check-in was done pretty quick, and was given a room that overlooks the beach.  Room is very small compared to other HR hotels.  However it is properly equipped with LCD TV and CD player.  There is a small balcony with some plastic chairs and also towel hanger outside - very helpful if you want to dry out those swimsuits! 

The bathroom has a small, Japanese-type bathtub (I believe they call it ""Onsen""???) cum shower with a very deep walls.  I don't understand the decision to have this facility installed.  Is it because they have more Japanese tourists here? Or to be able to have a ""bathtub"" or something like that in such a tight space? 
First, it's not very easy for children to climb in and out of it, and it has its own danger of slipping on the hard tile - Second, it takes forever if you ever want to fill it up for a bath! 

Breakfast - average, not too many choices available, so it was a disappointment, added by the attitude of the surly people who works there in the gloomy lighted restaurant.  The waiters/waitresses there clearly resent their work, since they all work with mechanical-like efficiency but with hardly a smile or cheerful disposition, so unlike the HR Bali with the bright open air restaurant, broad breakfast choices and cheerful staff. 

Not all staff are surly and gloomy - the Pool staff turns out to be lots of fun.  They really entertain the children staying at the hotel, providing lots of games and have nightly Wii games set up on large projector screen for them to play.  They are very quick to respond to your requests, whether it is for additional towels or for the menu when you require something from the restaurant or bar. 

The pool at HR Pattaya is quite nice, with some sandy beach portion and a floating trampoline - but the layout cannot beat the one in Bali which must have been more carefully planned to support the activities around the pool.  

The HR Cafe next door is a great place to dine, and they have friendly staff abound who will help you out with recommending things on the menu and explaining the items in Kid's menu to your children.  They are a great help when you have to feed 2 kids properly on your own!  

We're planning on early check out to catch a morning flight from Bangkok, so we asked for breakfast boxes, and the staff at the front desk happily helped us with the request. 

It takes some time to check out since the only person that can check me out was not available in the morning, and I have to wait for quite some time.

I had emailed hotel a few times to confirm that we would like to book one room with two single beds and the other room with one king size bed. Upon check in, the front desk staff verified these details and allocated our rooms. When I entered my room I was surprised to find two single beds (which are the size of double beds each!!) and not the king size I had communicated only 5 minutes earlier and which I was supposedly allocated by the front desk staff. My friends' room was as requested. I called and asked for room with king size bed and they obliged, however, I had to wait a further hour while a room was prepared. Although only a minor complaint, thankfully the rest of our stay was fantastic!

I must admit, though, that the king size bed room was much smaller than my friends' room with the two double beds- their room was huge, though my room did have a small balcony. The beds and pillows are super corfortable, lots of entertainment value using TV (you have to pay more for more of an extensive range), internet is expensive at BAHT400 per 24 hour period. Minibar, laundry, spa treatments and onsite restaurants all rather expensive too which was expected.

Gym was well equiped, pool area was huge but not too deep, staff were quirky but still friendly and helpful, breakfast was fantastic with vast selection to choose from, beach just across the road.

Location wise, it is about 10-15 minute walk to most of the popular big shopping centres and about 20 minute walk to Walking Street- that is for most fit and able people walking at a good pace. Probably add another 10 minutes if you prefer to slow walk. However, I think many people just chose to take a shared taxi or metered taxi as it is a decent distance away. We preferred to walk everywhere and take all the craziness of Pattaya in. Just to mention, there is no shortage of restaurant offerings!!!

The hotel does have many kids staying here, but I still do recommend to singles and couples too as they did not affect our stay at all!!

I was in Hard Rock on 20th and 21st of Nov 2015 and what a stay I had . It was totally memorable and I took a bunch of memories with me since the day I checked in. The pool is more than awesome , Water is soft and very clean . 

The view from the room was Pool View and Sea View - a super view one can have .

Pros :
Clean and Beautiful Room
Staff - BIG FIVE STAR - Very Warm , the guy at reception and specially the guy who assisted us in breakfast , Just Super and Rocking guys
Just in front of Jomtien Beach, Malls, Walking Street ,Indian Restaurants 
Most of it - these people understood ENGLISH very well and did not have any question marks on their faces whilst asking something 
Currency Exchange as well is in front of the hotel which offers good exchange rates .

Cons:
1.Very Small Webs in the corner were there in my room's balcony  - I felt it should be taken care seriously - not a good thing for a such a nice property
2.Men's washroom near the pool side was not  very clean - Please take care 
3.Lastly - Foam Party - It was a biggest attraction for me to stay in Hard Rock - As there were Stags every where with no security (Bouncers) around. I went with my wife and came out real quick as the crowd was bad and finally we opted for pool rather than going into the foam party . 

The hotel is very good and a great property to visit , just few pointers I felt Hard Rock must consider .",mike0730,Date of stay: November 2015,5,"Mumbai, India",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,5-Location,4-Cleanliness,5-Service,null,null,null,,

This Hard Rock Hotel Pattaya epitomizes the word!

We checked in on a Friday night and had a friendly, informational front desk agent.  It was almost as if he anticipated my questions, and was extremely thorough, all the while providing helpful information.

Our room was great.  We were celebrating my son's birthday, and the hotel had a cake waiting for him in the room.  Delicious, and it really got the weekend off to a perfect start!

We had a drizzly Saturday morning, but our spirits were lifted by the friendly smiles at the breakfast buffet.  Flawless!   Our table was bused regularly, and we enjoyed the wide-ranging choices of food (bacon!)  Delicious pastries, hot waffles, French toast, and pancakes, made-to-order eggs, fruit, yogurt, Asian cuisine, and much, much more were available.

From there it was off to the pool.  There were regular activities, well-spaced.  Especially noteworthy was the OUTSTANDING staff.  Ultra friendly, so cheerful, and extremely personable.  Sax and his team provided the perfect balance of both kid- and adult-friendly activities.  They called us and other guests by name, creating such a comfortable atmosphere.  Poolside food and beverage service was great, too!

My kids loved the foam party Saturday evening at 5 p.m.  What a unique, fun experience.  They made some wonderful memories!

Used the fitness center the next morning, and the equipment was well-maintained.  The buffet breakfast was not a complete repeat of the morning before (which was refreshing) but included many of the favorites I was hoping to see.  Another fabulous morning with the pool staff, which included rock climbing and ""walking on water"".  Pool floats are available to rent, and there's pool basketball always available, too - not to mention the kids' waterslides in a separate, sandy pool area.

My son loved having (free!) access to a wide-range of family and action movies in the room.  We all loved the personal attention and positive, fun-loving vibe we got from everyone working on the property.

I'm really not sure how they do it, but they have really found a fantastic combination of personalities that lead to an exceptional experience for the guests at Hard Rock Hotel Pattaya!!!!!",DesertDweller32,Date of stay: January 2016,5,Phoenix AZ,Trip type: Traveled with family,5-Value,5-Service,5-Sleep Quality,null,null,null,,

On the 2nd night, we ordered room service so that we can sit in our room to watch the fireworks on the bay in front of the hotel. We had the best seats on the house from our balcony.

It was very comfortable and made us feel like sleeping at home. The bathrooms also were very nice and roomy. Everything we got in that suite was worth the money we paid for.

Breakfast was enchanting, probably the best in Pattaya area, with handful choices of some exceptional dish to choose from.

We used the hotel transport from Bangkok to Pattaya I must say that the gentleman who drove us is the best driver I have had in Asia who goes by the name of “Lucky.”
The hotel staff were lovely and very accommodating but don’t go for the water activity tours there is no personal touch what’s so ever we felt like cattle in a herd getting shipped of to the abattoir mass tourism at its worst.

When we arrived we  were taken straight to the 9th floor as we had booked an upgrade to Rock Royalty. Check-in was fast and we were shown to our room. 
Everything about the room was excellent, fresh and clean. Previous review mentioned the rooms being tired but I definitely did not find this. We paid a bit extra for a sea view room and so glad we did as waking up to that view every morning was well worth it.
Every night we got a turn down service with a little cakes and a newspaper deliver every morning which was a nice touch.
It was also my husbands birthday whilst we were there and they left a cake and a birthday card in our room which was lovely.
The pool was lovely serving excellent drinks (strawberry margaritas were amazing)and food.
We also had a full body message from the spa and it's possibly the best message we've ever had.

Our first night at the hotel we went out the front entrance (at the beach) and headed to  the left (heading to walking Street)... this was a big mistake as it gave us a really bad first impression of Pattaya (really quite sleazy, and couldn't find a bar to drink in) however after this we found some lovely places and once you figure the place out with the tuck tuck there are lots of nice places to eat and drink.

From the back (main) entrance, end of the street go left and about 10 minute walk up there's a McDonald's and jst past that is Tandoori House - jst a wee hut with a few plastic chairs outside really small menu but OMG... the tastiest indian food ever - with a garlic nan.
