I was seriously impressed by the performances and now have marked this a regular spot I will be going back to for live music. Boy- the main act, is playful, entertaining and exceptional on the electric guitar. There were local expats who got up on the stage and sang some covers, which added to the whole experience. Looking around the bar, everyone was mesmerized by his stage presence as he held us all in the palm of his hand.

I went there on a Friday and Saturday night and found the Friday to be much better and busier. This was most likely due to the owner himself - Boy, playing with his own band.

The drinks are reasonable, the atmosphere is pleasant and yes... there is smoking but unlike others have reported it is a bit annoying but the fab music makes up for it. There is a tip box in front of the stage and I encourage you to throw in a respectable amount of baht as the entertainment is first class. The crowd is multicultural and the staff is attentive but not pushy. I don't care where you're from... If you enjoy great blues played by some guys who love music and aren't afraid to show it..

Boy is one of those gifted people that can play a guitar like he was born with it. He often has musicians in the audience come up and jam, but the amazing part is that it comes together like he has been playing with them for years. You can see boy every night, and every night is just a little different in his guitar playing, he improvises upon his mindset that night.

I have been to some very good music venues in Chicago, New York, California and Seattle/Portland. Great music venues can be difficult to find in Thailand with any songs you might recognize from the classic rock and blues era. Boy Blues Bar in Chiang Mai is a true gem! It is the perfect blend of Thai and expat 'farang' musicians who live in Chiang Mai. The Monday night jam night was incredible. There were about a dozen different musicians and they were all very good. The house drummer would give Mitch Mitchell of the Jimi Hendrix band a run for his money! Yes, he was that good! Boy, the owner and lead guitar player, is an awesome guy, and he's got some serious chops on electric guitar. He is probably one of the best blues/rock guitar players in Thailand! He sings very well too. We liked Boy Blues Bar so much we returned for 2 more nights. We went there 3 times in 7 nights. No other music venue in Chiang Mai came close to as good. The bar is covered by a giant roof but it is open to the night air. Chiang Mai is cool at night and fresh air in a bar is nice. Feels like you are outside but still protected from rain. The night market is next door. Great night..eat at and explore the night market and then go to Boy Blues Bar around 8:30pm. Music starts up shortly after. If you are in a large group, get there earlier so you can find seats. The place fills up quickly by 9pm.",Bill C,"November 5, 2019",5,"Bellingham, WA",Jan-19

As the bands rotated, there were some American country singers, maybe making a last ditch attempt to make it in Thailand. Okay if you like that sort of thing. I wouldnt be fooled by the name of the bar- there wasn't a hint of blues music. At times it felt a little like slightly up market karaoke. As the crowd started to build, it was very apparent that this place attracts older white men with young Thai women. Some men arrived on their own and in no time, had a young Thai girl draped over them at the bar. Perhaps this is a pick up point for this sort of thing. I am not naive enough to think that this sort of culture isn't present in Thailand. We personally just found it a little uncomfortable at times as it was so prolific in this particular bar. Perhaps a certain clash in cultures and valuing women's rights etc made us feel this way. I think if you are expecting it and are more comfortable with the Thai bride/ sex trafficking side of things then this would be less of an issue. Mixed feelings about this place.

It’s very close to the boxing ring and the restaurant that has seating like a food court. Of course, once you get close just follow the sound of live blues to the staircase that leads up to the bar. Like many Thai bars, there is live music by local artists covering western songs. The opening act plays the same (good) set every night. That’s where this bar suddenly changes from the normal Thai mold. The owner (?) of the bar is a real character, and he starts to play at about 9 or so most nights. His talent (and that of his band) is that they play blues the way blues is meant to be played: from the heart, not from the songbook. He starts a song by playing enough of a riff for the drummer and bassist to come in, then off they go with whatever the feel like. All three are top-notch players, and they work together really well. You’ll know it’s them because the guitarist has the most amazing facial expressions (smiles, goofy grins, looks of surprise, etc) that are perfect punctuation to the music. And on Monday nights at about 9pm the jam session starts. Musicians from all around the world who are working and living in Chiang Mai gather and put on a great blues/rock session until midnight or so. There are a couple players who are absolutely fantastic, and several more who are good in their own right but do very well as part of the jam. Get your food at the aforementioned restaurant and bring it upstairs with you… it’s a great place to listen to live music, eat a late meal, and talk with expats for a while to get your western culture fix in the middle of your vacation.",seawolf42,"December 27, 2014",5,"Honolulu, HI",Dec 2014 • Friends

Actually, our back then 3 year old daughter discovered the place by hearing the live music. She wanted to visit the 'party', so we went up the stairs. We had a great time. Good bands, good music and if you are in luck, you will hear Boy play himself. Very good atmosphere and Boy is just so much fun watching him play. We ended up there 4 nights out of 5 we stayed in Chiang Mai and this year we went back. If you are in Chiang Mai you just pay Boy a visit and find out for yourself. This year he played the friday an saturday night round 21:30. Have fun!",Tim Hasenbosch,"April 21, 2016",4,"Hoofddorp, The Netherlands",Apr 2016 • Family

After having been to the Boy Blues Bar last Saturday night already, I came here the second time now at about nine o'clock, heard a very good group playing until a quarter to ten, and then I was blown my mind. That's why I came there, and I will come there again and again. Great place and a fantastic band called Boy Blues Band. The bass guitarist is absolutely stunning, absolutely brilliant, and to see WHERE he is picking the strings..., oh my goodness. My fingertips would be bleeding. He's even playing chords and flageolets on his bass guitar and the quickest quavers I ever heard on bass guitar. The drummer is, this is the first impression only, unobtrusive but he is absolutely versatile and absolutely versed and, as the bass guitarist does, keeps the band grooving, and he's still so young. And Boy on electric guitar is - how to put into words what I saw and heard - exceptional. He is in a class of his own and one of the best guitar players I ever heard, and I heard many the last 50 years. He is absolutely authentic and a very likeable musician with tremendous charisma and endowed with a voice which was made to sing the blues. These three guys know very well how to create the vibes with their audience, and they love to create those vibes with their audience. The good news is: the audience does not mind at all. Do I have to say that Boy creates amazing sounds, he and his guitar and his small amp, no pedals, no electronical tricks...!!! He and his guitar and his amp create his sounds. There's no technical gimmicks, there's ""only"" Boy's artistry and virtuosity. Quite often I got the idea - the idea was slipping into my mind yesterday - that Peter Green who had been an outstanding musician would love Boy's music and the way the band is reinterpreting the standards and, moreover, the way the band is able to make a sparkling pearl even out of a simple song. These three guys are awesome. Groovy music. Great music. Really great music. Super-fine blues music. Boy Blues Bar is the spot where they never let you down when you want to listen to the blues and when you are longing to feel the blues, and if you bring the blues along with you in the evening, climbing up the staircase, you have to know that these three guys make you feel much better within a few minutes. They share your blues, and amazingly enough, you will no longer want to get rid of your blues. What's more: nice and very relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff, good beers and beverages, fair prices. What a lovely place! Who said blues is founded on cotton-fields... I got wise and I'd say blues is flourishing and blossoming and blooming and being in flower on rice-fields as well. Equally well or maybe even better. And isn't Lan Na ""the land of the thousand rice-fields""? In few words: Boy Blues Bar is absolutely a must for everybody who is coming to Chiang Mai. It is even one more good reason to come to Chiang Mai. No, it is a reason on its own to come here to CM and hear the Boy Blues Band play.",Jurgen H,"November 14, 2013",5,"Trier, Germany",Nov 2013 • Couples

That is Boy Blues Bar! The name comes from Boy, the owner and master rhythm guitar player. He and his band play most nights if he isn’t traveling or teaching the young musicians of Chiang Mai, and there’s usually a 2nd band each night as well. The music is not unexpectedly blues and soul but Saturday night there is a fantastic 7-piece band that plays funky 70s and 80s sounds and they are brilliant! Monday or Tuesday (can’t remember which) is jam night where anyone with any talent can get up and play, or sing. You’d be surprised at the amount of musicians traveling through CM who find their way to BBB! Drinks are reasonably priced considering there is no entrance fee but please, if you do go buy a drink each eh? Seeing two or three folk sharing one beer is a bit sad and detrimental to everyone.

Performing when I arrived was a slender Auatralian lady whose looks were entirely belied by the stunniing powerful Blues voice across a range of registers as she assured us she had her Mojo working. She clearly revelled in the music whch made her performance all the more infectious. When she sat down she showed a similar and really genuine appreciation of the musicians who replaced her. Who were all quite excellent: two great guitarists, lead and bass, a singer and another singer who blew up a storm on harmonica.

The bar staff were very unorganized and it took over 20 minutes to get served even though there was only 2 people at the bar getting drinks. The system in which the bar operated needs to be fixed, as there is no need for 3-4 people organizing drinks for only one person serving the drinks. To me it was a major let down, even though the music was amazing. The other thing was the seating, Even though the venue is small and ""boutique"" the seating could have been more comfortable than some wooden benches.

You can tell that even after doing for god knows how many years he was still incredibly happy to be doing it.

The house band is good, the service is good, and Boy (the owner) seems like a truly nice and caring person with a ton of tolerance and a perpetual smile adoring his face.

The other kid would have been around 14 or so and man could this kid play the guitar.... Finishing off with some Hendrix, what a crowd pleaser these kids were, just truly amazing.

I've been to New Orleans more than once in my life, as well I have experienced truly amazing blues and jazz at many other destinations. Considering that this takes place in C.M.

I don't do umbrellay drinks or anything like that (not that there would be space to make fancy cocktails behind that tiny busy bar anyways) but I am not a huge beer drinker, so I tend to go for a classic like G&T when no other choices. They do use generic spirits, not the best quality. Not expecting Hendricks gin, but I'd happily pay an extra 20 Bath to get a Bombay&tonic.
