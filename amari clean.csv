We happily accepted as this was our first time in Thailand, and had already visited Patong Beach, Koh Phi Phi and Kamala Beach. He booked us into the Amari for the Easter Long Weekend.
We arrived at the hotel on Saturday afternoon and were warmly welcomed. Checkin was professional and courteous and we were soon escorted to our ocean view room on the 17th floor. The room and view did not disappoint. Loved the open concept layout. Bed was one of the best we have slept on. Everything from linens, towels, robes, slippers,  etc. was top notch.
As others have commented on, the breakfast buffet was exceptionally good and the service was outstanding considering how busy it was on this weekend.
We enjoyed the Brazillian feast in the Tavern restaurant that we highly recommend. Excellent selection of meats and shrimp at a very reasonable price. Very good wine selection as well that didn't break the bank.
This hotel deserves the high ranking it has received on Tripadvisor. Will stay here again if the opportunity presents itself for a return to Pattaya Beach.",brianwilson50,??.?.-15,5,"Deep Cove, Canada",Couple,null,null,null,null,null,null

We ate at the Mantra twice,and the food and service was first class,right up there with Dubai imo.We also ate at the Tavern by the sea,and all the meals were great,at very good prices.Pattaya was an eye opener,but we found plenty good bars,with live music,or backing tapes to enjoy,and are thinking of returning to this hotel next year.Finally,my wife had an accident coming out the Mantra,where she fell off the kerb,its' a bit dark,and cut her knee,but a manager saw this,and immediately dealt with it,by taking her into restaurant and getting staff to give her first aid,really good public relations,i think the manager guy worked in the Tavern,as he came up to ask how she was,next day.All in all i'd recommend Ocean Tower,as it's a great standard of hotel,and we will almost certainly be back",MrandMrsMcN,??.?.-14,5,scotland,Couple,5-Value,5-Rooms,5-Location,5-Cleanliness,5-Service,5-Sleep Quality

Two improvements stand out: the Horizon Club has made a discernible step in the quality of its cuisine and selection of wines. Secondly, and of great import to this gastronome is the significant improvement in the quality of the food in all the resort's venues: it has always been good but now it is better.  There are deft little touches indicating that the priority is quality.  In particular is the difference in one of my favorite restaurants in all the countries I have visited: The Mantra.  It is one of the main reasons  I return to Amari Orchid.  Such a striking decor!  Now there is a new culinary master guiding it and the rest of the resort.

Firstly, location, the hotel is located on the ""north"" end right on the beach road which has some advantages and disadvantages. Disadvantage is that the beach road is 5km long and the Central shopping mall is 2,5km away in the centre of the beach road and walking street, is on the southern end of the beach road, which is quite a walk away. But on the plus side, for me the location is a positive because it is away from the noisy bars and clubs and has a real peaceful feel to the place as you can mostly only hear the jetskis and boats in the ocean across the road. Tuk tuks drive from the north end of beach road all the way down to the southern end and pass by the hotel every few seconds during the day and night you can hop on and off at any point for 10baht which then really makes the location no problem at all.
The staff are very friendly and welcoming, and very visible all over the hotel. The Ocean tower is the newish wing of the hotel and is very modern and posh. The rooms are also very well looked after, clean, modern, and a pleasure to stay in. The beds are very comfortable and the linen always looks as good as new. As for room location, the hotel building runs perpendicular to the beach so the one end of the hotel building is close to the beach and has great views whereas the back end of the building is more inland and has garden views on the one side and a view of the neighboring holiday inn hotel on the other side. So try to book an ocean view room, close to the ocean side of the hotel. Or even better, try to book a ocean view junior suite, which has a spectacular panoramic view of the entire bay of pattaya. 
The hotel has a couple of good food options if you choose to dine in, I love the Sports bar which is overlooking the beach, great international and thai menu options as well as different buffet specials every evening, worth a try. The pool side bar is also great for snacks and small meals while relaxing at the pool and  they have some great happy hour specials which are great value for money. For those looking for fine dining, the hotel has a Mantra restaurant which is one of the finest restaurants in Pattaya, its not cheap, but the food is more of an artistic experience than just a meal.
I also make regular visits to the hotel spa. Yes it costs 2 or 3 times the price of an ordinary massage in the street, but this is a much more refined massage experience and a safe choice for a good massage rather than guessing which place to choose in one of the streets and being disappointed or worse, being injured.
All in all, as you can see, I have no bad feedback from this hotel. I've stayed here many times and if I've had the smallest of complaints, they were attended to are resolved immediately. I've stayed here in all times of the year, in the peak seasons, in the quiet seasons, and the service has always been the same, without any problems.
Just a tip when booking, join the Onyx rewards program before booking for additional discounts and benefits, and also be sure to take advantage of the regular promotion prices that the hotel offers from time to time.

We really miss the swim up bar for socialising,although the pool bar staff again were great,met Surusak again,like an old friend,and the bar manager from Sri Lanka,was really nice,Childmina or something 🤷🏻‍♂️.The Mantra being closed is a big loss,as is the Tavern by the sea,as we ate there often for lunch and dinner,and enjoyed the live music that was always on.The Ice bar was a nice bar too,but that’s away also.The hotel has no real reason for people to stay after 8 pm,as there’s no bars or entertainment on site after this time.We did love the new pool,and the kids zone looks great for young ones too.All in all,if things stay as they are,I’m not sure we’ll be back, as we picked Amari because of the great facilities,but most of them are now gone,hopefully the buffet will return in Executive club,and the a swim up bar will get incorporated somewhere,and perhaps the new eatery in Mantra location might be of real quality.

On my way to Pattaya, I knew some friends from China. It was their first time and they have not booked their hotel. So I recommended Amari Ocean and we stayed for 3 nights.
I decide not to disclose the unhappy experience that I had in one of the day as there was an incident happened value more to be mentioned.
Few years ago, I had a bad experience in Holiday XXX in Phuket as I got stolen few thousands (HKD) in the hotel room where it was mistakenly not kept in the safe. So, I reminded myself to keep valuable stuff in the safe every time.
This time, I put my money (HKD8000) in the safe, however, I forgot to unlock it. I saw a note on the bed stating that the safe was not lock while I was away. 
OMG, I just left the room for 20 minutes to visit my friends on the other floor and I was told that the lockers was not locked. I contact the front office immediately and manager came up about 10 minutes later.
I was so worry during the waiting as I had an bad experience before and hoping for a miracle. When I met the manager, she tried to open it for a few times but due to some technical problems, she was unable to open it and need to get a technician to do it, It took another 15 minutes. 
The safe was finally opened and what I saw was, all the money was inside and there were none gone missing. Thanks God and thanks Amari. It was my first day of trip and all my money was there, if I lost them, I was going to had a poor trip.
Sorry that I forgot the name of the manager but I promised to write a review again. I told the manager about the negative incident that happened to me during my stay and I was about to give the hotel a negative comment and I showed her the review that I have prepared..
Thanks to the hotel again and the training to their staffs. Service with honesty is the most important element to me now. You never know what happen inside the room while you were away. You know how difficult to control the evil mind when you see the money with no one around.
Manager who see this review please help me to find out who the staffs (house keeping and managers) were and I would love to met them again on my next visit.
Sorry that I need to give you a 4 stars as there was another incident happened for the deduction. I believe you will be given a 5 stars for next time!

The first impression was that we found trash left in several bins and room was dirty with leftover. Not sure if they cleaned the room but provided slippers were still wet so that might answer the question. The bathroom also had smelly sewage.
The next day, we called housekeeping before we went out only to come back and found that no one came to clean the room. We called guest service to ask why housekeeping wasn't done. Initially, they even tried to blame us for putting ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on which we definitely did not do it. Later, they admitted that they were short of manpower.
Actually, they were understaffed throughout the hotel. For example, staff at the breakfast room ran around like a headless chicken while guests had to find and arrange their own tables.

I booked directly at Amari website and understood that the hotel do not charge anything for extra beds (we did'nt need it anyway since we were in family room). Travel sites like MMT etc. are quoting extra charges.
We also used the spa in the hotel but I suggest to go out, you can easily find very decent massage centers everywhere at very reasonable price. For the ones traveling with kids, the kids club in the Amari garden is a good option where you can leave your kid for few hours in the day.

One word of warning we found the food around the pool area of the Amari to be very low quality.
The rooms in Ocean Tower have a really modern open plan bathroom arrangement which is very cool however starting to look a little worn in places.

The title typifies my attitude, especially after the Covid issues we have all put up with of late.  Covid constraints in the Bangkok area were recently eased and so I decided to take up the Amari 'special offer' and ‘just go for it’.  Four nights, Tue-Fri, ""Let's go to Pattaya"".
Arrival at the Amari was 2pm and we were greeted by some very efficient members of the concierge team, who swiftly and courteously (speaking English too) whisked our luggage away.  Wow that was easy!  But ... check in was just as easy, if not easier!  Things were going like clockwork ... and then I saw the new Amari brand logo,  ""Welcome to the bright side of life!""  
At this point I just knew things were going to be good ... and so they were.  The place was 'squeaky clean' with Covid sanitizer available just about everywhere.  So, up to the 17th floor and I felt really comfortable, thanks to the electronic security systems in the elevators and the rooms
Our room was nicely attired, exceedingly clean and airy, with everything as advertised, even the view and … the luggage arrived within minutes of our arrival in the room.  Things were looking good.  So far so good, in fact ‘very good’!   I was looking forward to a nice long soak in a hot bath before bed time.  But before that, a quick look outside to see what was around.  A few steps along the road we came across Gulliver’s Bar.  Know them well via their Gulliver’s Bangkok Bar.  Good food and good service in both places.
The soak in the hot bath was calling me … and again I was not at all disappointed.  A big bath, plenty of hot water, a tumbler of red wine, what could be better, now I was really happy and would soon be ready to test the bed.
The bed was just fine and the sleep was just what was needed, in a good cool, quiet room with a big comfy bed.  Pure magic!  
But if that was good, it was even better when we went for breakfast the following morning.  I was fully expecting a limited service as a result of the Covid constraints, but not so.  A full breakfast service was available; Thai food, Western food, Asian food, salad bar, a Ham and eggs counter, breakfast cereals, cold cuts and cheeses, bakery delights, fruit juices, plus of course a selection teas of coffees.  I must admit I was somewhat bewildered being confronted with such an array of food when I really did not expect it.  Anyway, not to be daunted I made a point of trying each section during our stay.  Maybe I missed a couple and what I didn’t try my wife did.
In summary, everything we tried was really good.  The best? …  Hmmmm … I think a couple of the Thai dishes had the edge over everything else.  
I should add that I ate in the restaurant one evening and had an excellent steak.  Much better than one I had the previous night in town.
But before I close, I did have a magical moment after I’d ‘had a few’ at the poolside ‘Happy Hour’.  Well after all, it was my birthday!  Anyway, I had been back in the room only a matter of minutes when the doorbell rang.  I opened the door and there, to my surprise, was a staff member who presented me with a birthday card and a gorgeous cake delicacy, perhaps a White Chocolate-Strawberry Tiramisu? I am no not too sure, but also there on the presentation plate was ‘Happy Birthday’ written in chocolate ‘handwriting script’.   How magical was that!!  Rest assured, the cake tasted as good as it looked!
So … a big ‘THANK YOU’ to the Amari staff for organising that one.  
We departed back home to Bangkok the following day, after spending 4 delightful nights at the Pattaya Amari,  and I would like to say a sincere thanks to ALL staff, who made our stay a memorable one,  
To conclude;  I would like to say special thanks to Mr Jan Lorenzen,  Director, F&B Onyx-hospitality, who frequently checked our wellbeing whenever our paths crossed, but …  may I now also ask a favour of Mr Lorenzen please?
When you conduct your next staff meeting, please let your staffs know that they all deserve a special “Thank You”.  It was so nice to see happy, smiling and courteous service throughout the establishment.  ‘THANK YOU ALL’. 
Suffice to say: “Always look on the bright side of life”.

I had breakfast each day in the lounge which was fine. The views from the lounge are stunning. The highlight of the lounge is the evening drinks and canapés session from 17.30 to 19.30. The food was  excellent it was varied every evening. The wine was also very drinkable. The staff remember you and constantly top up your glass. I will definitely return.

Upon arrival decor and furniture was worn and roller blind was rather creased. Ants shared my room and no matter where you went by taxi minimum charge was 300 baht. Even across the road. Now from bkk airport to Siam Square was only 300-400 plus toll charges. Total 400-500 baht for 30-45 min journey.
Most staff were pleasant enough at Amari but those sit behind the office desks looks miserable and will rob you blind with any request. So stay away. I requested a taxi booking next morning to take me to BKK airport they were happy to charge me 4000 baht. I said I don't want hotel limo service they denied and they tried to force limo service on me. I had to walk away to find a taxi service myself. Look online guys Pattaya Taxi to Airport.
I stayed at many hotels from Kempinski to intercontinental to Shangri la to Hilton even the Nol in BkK they would never do this! Maybe the red light district has corrupted their minds from good customer service. 
I was forced to book my own taxi founded online and it was only 1000 baht I ordered a SUV for comfort cost me net 1200baht, I tipped 200baht.
I will stay away from this hotel like the plaque. Absolutely irate for ethical reasons.
I honestly suggest the Hilton instead. If its your first time the mall beneath is great! and basically central. Amari is on the most left far side.
Pattaya city center main road runs like a roundabout one way and those big tuk tuk taxis will only cost 10baht per person. Sometimes they will kick you off half way but it's only 10baht never mind eh. 
If it is a budget thing then the Amari has the basics of facilities and breakfast is reasonable. However peak season breakfast will be more lavish. Still the Hilton I wi chose. Enjoy your holiday.",Matthew L,??.?.-15,1,"Hong Kong, China",Friends,null,null,null,null,null,null

The entire set up was superb, and the service second to none.  The hotel continues to provide excellent service in all aspects of customer care and in all honesty I cannot think of one thing to criticise.  
If you should encounter a problem during your stay  senior management and all staff are always willing to help you and promptly sort out any issues/problems you may have.  They are happy to give advice on any issues  about Thai protocol - this was especially useful this time during the Coup don't be afraid to approach them as they are very proactive and approachable.
The hotel continues to ensure all facilities are regularly improved and in the past twelve months have introduced several new ones.  This includes a varied and interesting child activity programme which is held daily near to the pool areas, and although my children are now adults I think it ideal that children can be supervised and entertained whilst parents can relax by the pool without worrying about them while at the same can keep a tentative eye on them. There is also opportunity to do aqua aerobics if you feel like getting energetic.
The Tavern Sports Bar continues to provide different themed evening meals which can be eaten outside or inside the Restaurant depending on your personal wishes.  Two new additions are a barbecued Ribs and Wings, and Funky Chicken evenings.   During the meal you can fill your boots! Eat as much as you want, the price includes a very nice buffet as well as hot and cold food including potatoes and rice.  These evenings are in addition to the regular Curry Night and Sunday Brunch. This time there was also a wine tasting evening with a wine specialist speaker - something a bit different!

We had some renovations done and had to stay in a hotel locally for 3 nights over a weekend. I chose the Amari Ocean for a few reasons.
Location is to the North of the city, out of the bad traffic areas. It's actually the northern most hotel on the Baht Bus loop. 
Many hotels in the Pattaya get descended upon by swarms of rabid locusts, politely referred to locally as ""tour groups"". There's nothing polite about them, they move en masse and leave swathes of boorishness behind them. If you find yourself at a plagued hotel, there's no holiday to be had - just some anxiety and realignment of goodwill toward your fellow man. At Amari Ocean YOU ARE SAFE, it's a hotel full of courtesy and humility from other guests (mix of business and vacation) and staff alike. I did see some Australians, but they kept to themselves. :-)
We stayed on Executive Lounge floor which was worth it for the drinks, treats and service, a lovely quiet area to read the papers and mags and have a coffee. All gratis. It was really special. Room was excellent also. New, modern, well decorated. 
B'fast is as good as I've seen anywhere. Common areas and tropical gardens are huge. There's two big pools to choose from, well maintained, clean, even a swim up pool bar and many lounger booths to relax by the pool.

Few minutes later another staff came to check if everything was ok, he even offered an ice cream to my daughter such a nice gesture. Later we ordered some pizzas at the pool bar which unfortunately took a long time to arrive. The team was very apologetic and organized a fruit plate for dessert as compensation. Further to this we even received a phone call from the director of food and beverage later in the afternoon to apologize and to offer clearing the bill. Another great example of outstanding service was the front desk staff I dealt with to book the dinner. When I mentioned it was my son's birthday she immediately organized a small cake for the celebration despite the very short notice. Just wow!!

We left for breakfast and when I came back to the pool alone an old German couple were sitting there and our Japanese books with beach bags were taken out. 
I told them that we were sitting there and just left for breakfast. The lady said "" We have been staying 2 months. These are our seats"". Then surprisingly took a magazine from under the mattress.

After a while he came back and told us that they didn't see what happened exactly so they can not do anything.
The next day we got up 5:30 in the morning and found a pair of flip flops and a magazine under the mattress. We moved those and I stayed until my husband came back from breakfast.
We talked to the manager again and told him that it was not right to put their things under the chair over night. Normally many hotels flip the mattresses over after dark and make sure there is nothing left. He said "" Yes we understand but it will take for a while to change.""
I have a friend who is a Japanese hotel manager who used to work in Thailand. She had the same complains from guests. She immediately patrolled every morning. I wonder why they can not do the same thing. A few days later the general manager came by the German couple and talked to them for a while with a big smile. He should have known by that time that we complained about those rude people. We concluded that he does not care about treating all the guests the same way but cares only about the long stay guests. That is not a five star hotel's management.
The housekeepers were quite forgetful. Almost everyday they forgot hand towels or did not replace a shower cap. I guess they don't have a check sheet as a hotel standard.",thaiko,?.?.-15,3,"Bangkok, Thailand",Couple,3-Value,3-Location,3-Service,null,null,null

Yes it’s a slight inconvenience but Amari have reflected this within their pricing structure at present.  Check in was excellent, a soothing cold flannel and cold herb drink with that hospitable Thai welcome. We arrived a little early (11am) but staff bent over backwards to get us into our room by 1pm so our luggage was kept safe and well whilst we took a nice space around the pool. We went to our room at 1.30pm and was welcomed by a spacious, clean and modern open-plan type room, with a fully stocked mini-bar, large bath, large flat screen Tv, a large very comfortable bed, bath robes, great shower, his n her sinks and a balcony looking partially across the sea, pool and yes, the building site that I’ve already mentioned. The glass seems to be doing a great job keeping most of the noise out I might add! 
So, next day was breakfast of course and probably one of the most important things a hotel must get right at least. Greeted by a host of very experienced staff with a smile and escorted in to the charming and well decorated areas which was immaculately clean. There was nothing you couldn’t have wished for more, fresh fruits and yoghurts, eggs station which was manned by a chef to cook your eggs however way you wanted them, pancakes, bacon, salad, Thai, Japanese,Korean and English palates all covered for marvellously. Nothing was scrimped on, this was a 5* breakfast experience and coffee or tea served to you in a silver service fashion. So, after the fantastic breakfast experience we took our seats to the pool, we weren’t too bothered about venturing out to the beach just across the road for the following reasons, it’s our Wedding Anniversary, we came to chill,read,listen to some music and just generally kick back and relax and on a personal level didn’t want to get involved in the Songkran celebrations. (We’ve done it all before) This area served us well, as did the staff around here. The 2 pool guys “Surasak and Boonahan” were outstanding, great with the greetings, fetched our towels, bought us our drinks and our lunch always with an outstanding attitude on our very comfortable sun-beds. They kept this place tip-top, even the security guy used to walk around and pick up leaves as it seemed he also cared about the surroundings of this pool area. Very impressed! 
Lunch menus were great, plenty to choose from and reasonably priced and quick to clean up so we weren’t left with dirty plates and cutlery attracting flies and bugs. Happy Hour was between 3-5pm but never used this service, just the soft drinks which were always ice-cold. Most days we were back to our impressively serviced room (17th floor) for a little siesta and a little relief from the heat. A little niggle about the room servicing, a couple of times the 2 free waters were forgotten but a quick call and they were replenished almost immediately. All our evenings we opted for room service off the menu and delivered to our room. Again, the food we had ranging from Chicken skewers to Pad Thai, Burgers, Club Sandwiches and Thai Green curry. All dishes were excellenty priced and were served to your room within 20 minutes, piping hot and again with a smile.
To summarise the Amari Ocean experience. Well Done All. Brilliantly trained friendly and hospitable staff, we’ve had a great time here and everyone involved have made it a truly relaxing welcoming experience and the WiFi was strong in all areas.

The Amari was great for us.
We were 2 adults & 2 kids (6 & 13) and reserved the regular twin bed room. Upon arrival the check in process takes too long as they make copies of all passports etc.
When we walk into our room, we spotted the extremely narrow twin beds, which seems more like 2 single beds.
I returned to the front desk and told them about the beds that can't accommodate 2 persons at any way. They immediately upgraded us to a family room! No questions asked and with a smile. Very friendly and helpful!
Our family room was a blast. The girls loved it. The room was big and had a 2 twin beds that we converted to a king.. (after moving the beds) & a set of bunk beds in corner of the room. Very comfortable for a family.
Complimentary drinking water & fruits were in the room on a daily basis. Room was very clean and had all 5 star hotel amenities.
Location was very good for our family as it's close enough to city center & attractions, but far enough from the chaotic walking street.. As the hotel is located at the beginning of Beach Road, it's very convenient to catch a 10 BHT Tuk Tuk just outside of the hotel that will take you to city center in 5 minutes.
Pool was great and had a nice bar in it. Happy hour in the bar was twice a day and this was awesome. If you wish to get cheap eats, there is a noodle stand at the pool area and dishes like soup with noodles & meet are sold for 100-150 THB.
I wouldn't say this hotel is the best for kids activities, but if your kids love to be in the pool, they will have a good time, but after a while, the kids might get bored.
There are 2 pools, as the ""older"" Amari Garden hotel is sharing the pool area so you can use both pools.
Breakfast was outstanding. Everything you can imagine.. They do have latte coffee, but you need to ask for it and they will serve it to your table.
Free Wi-Fi, and it was working great everywhere. 
The beach was not our thing, but if you wish to go the beach you will have to cross  Beach Road street to get there, just to find the very blurry water..

Excellent staff: always ready to help and go the extra mile to ensure that guests are looked after. The restaurant staff were excellent, always refilling our coffee and supplying our chosen breakfast requirements.  
The Horizon Club - fabulous way to spend a couple of hours - tasty, well-presented snacks and refreshments (great alternative to Essence for breakfast).  
Staff in the Tavern by the Sea, poolside, reception, housekeeping, security - all superb...Fabulous customer service.  
The GM Brendan, the Assistant GM Richard, the F and B manager Dan and many senior staff can be seen around the hotel checking that guests are happy. Each and everyone of them stopping to pass the time of day and to enquire if everything was to our satisfaction.
Location:  right on Beach Road...easy access to all areas of Pattaya.  Close enough for easy access, but far enough away from the 'madness' should you want complete relaxation.  The grounds and pools are well maintained and just what is needed in 90 degree heat...cold towels and fruit around the pool a welcome treat!
Rooms: large and spacious, our Tower room had everything we needed for a great stay.  Housekeeping was efficient, and the room was always cleaned to a high specification.  Plenty of storage, high water pressure meant that the shower was powerful. Thoughtful touches - bathrobe, slippers, tea and coffee making facilities plus a beach/pool  bag for your convenience...even an umbrella just in case!
This visit my husband was taken ill and needed to visit the hospital, we couldn't have wished for  better care at the hotel.  A taxi was summoned, the driver given explicit instructions, and the hospital advised of our imminent arrival.  The treatment at the hospital was faultless. On our return, the staff were so caring and considerate...every member of staff had been advised of my husband's condition, and all enquired as to his health at every opportunity.  The reservations team rang daily to check on him and a beautiful bouquet delivered to wish him well! Senior staff made a visit daily, again to check on his health.  The consideration to our well being was over and above anything we could have wished for- thank you, thank you, thank you Team Amari!

I went into the hotel one day to look around and have to say , very nice job of updating the rooms and reception area.
But outside OOPS !!!!!!!   The lovely pool area has been ravaged and the gardens where we have spent many relaxing and sunny hours GONE!!!!
The pool area is laid out in tiers and all the beds are laid out side by side reminiscent of the Spanish Costa hotels.
 They have installed a loopy slides and big buckets that overturn every 30 seconds or so.It is all very close together and the bright plastics make it lovely for the kids but not so great for adults without kids.
Having torn down the old outdated blocks of rooms in the gardens they have been replaced by an almost completed huge ""Duplex"" block PLUS they are halfway through building a 12 storey hotel that one of the staff told me would be ""Basic"" hotel.
In one of my reviews of this hotel several years ago I thanked the Amari group for making this hotel a haven of peace and tranquillity and not being a concrete jungle development so typical of the rest of Pattaya. But now it appears that Corporate

We also has the Club Deal.Be wary?????.when you by this there re rules and regs to follow.Dress in the evening,gents must wear closed footwear.i went dowcame down in flip flopsn 1 evening in semi closed leather sandals to be told by the manager go and change.However the next days when to japs arrived they all came down in flip flops.Nothing was said to them.If you inforced a dress code,do it for all and not some.The manager of the club was not the most friendly or and lacked customer service.She should not be doing that job.Also 1 night when it was busy had to wait for table to sit down,she had not catered or was ready for a large amount of people.If you pay for it ,get it and dont Q.Also the club rules do not extend to the pool.so if youwant Tea/Coffee/Cold drink etc by the pool you have to go the to 19 Floor have it there and come all the way down again.book your sun bed early as they are in short supply and go early.Family pool gets very busy and can be vary loud at times.If your kids go the the Kids club,you have to pay for it,be aware.
food is very average and very luke warm at best of times.Be careful where you sit in restaurant as the toilets are right in the middle of the restaurant and you could have a table right next to the gents,Lovely view????.Best to eat in town.Get Tuc Tuc( 10 Bht) per person from the Tavern at front of hotel and it will take you to Walking street etc and good food.
In all ,this hotel is not the best in pattaya and found the Centara Grand Mirage a lot better.It needs a good lick of paint to bring it up to standard and rules needs to change if you are to win back customers.The club lounge needs a new manager who can focus on their customers and not sit on the computer all day.Will not stay at this hotel again",tim0thy0liver,??.?.-15,2,"Greater London, United Kingdom",Family,2-Rooms,2-Cleanliness,2-Service,null,null,null

I booked a package deal from there website which offered good value and included 2 x free Thai massages at there spa and a gaurenteed late check out until 4pm.  With this package it included guaranteed upgrade to a Junior suite but they then upgraded me further to a duplex suite.  This also entitled free access to the executive lounge which included complimentary food and drinks from 7pm - 9pm.  The selection of food and drinks available in the executive lounge was some of the best I have ever seen with spirits, champagne, wine, soft drinks, canapés, cheeses and biscuits, desserts to name but a few.  The staff and service was also the best I have encountered, nothing was too much bother and you were always greeted with a hello and smile from each and every member of staff. 
Breakfast was also included and the selection again was the best I have seen with the highlight being fresh omelettes being cooked to order with over 10 ingredients to choose from to be added to the omelette.
The pool area was also superb with a swim up bar and a separate pool with jacuzzi.  The location is also very good and although it's the opposite end of the liveliest part of Pattaya you can easily jump on a tuk tuk for 20 Bhat and be there within 10 minutes.
I also used the transport from the hotel for pick up and drop off to the airport, although this is more expensive than a normal taxi it's is a quality car you receive with 2 fresh cold towels and 2 cold bottles of water provided for the journey and no hassles.
The room itself was also amazing, with a huge king size bed and very comfortable mattress.  There's a huge selection of toiletries offered everyday also including soap, shower gel, shampoo, moisturiser, toothbrush, shaving kit, detergent, cotton buds, sewing kit.  Water is also generously topped up everyday with over 8 bottles a day provided.  The safe is also very large and in the duplex suite you have a lounge with 42"" flat screen TV and DVD player and another flat screen TV in the bedroom which is upstairs.  Every room also has a balcony.  The gym although quite small has a good selection of cardio and equipment.
I also used the business lounge which has 2 computers which is linked to a printed and they also photocopied some documents for me.  This is where you can borrow DVDs where they have a small library for you to borrow a couple for your room.
WIFI was also an extremely good signal in the room and throughout the hotel, however you have to log in quite often if you don't use it for more than 10 minutes but is no big deal.
If I had one small gripe it would be that I asked for some ice for my water at the pool area, after the second request I was told by the bar staff that if I wanted ice I would have to order a bucket of ice for 50bhat.  Now I know that's not a lot but really you should not have to pay for ice no matter where you are in any hotel.
The other thing I'm not too happy about is I am still waiting on my ONYX points to be added to my account, even though I mentioned this at check out and have asked for this several times since my departure over 10 days ago.

We stayed in a room with a sea view and balcony. Initially we were shown a twin bedded room but turned this down as we had booked a double room. The staff are very friendly and attentive. Check in was quick and efficient, but check out was very slow. Housekeeping was a bit hit and miss. Some nights there was a turn down service, other nights there wasn't. I had to ask housekeeping to change one of the towels as it was torn and stained. Another day we had no bath mat. The hotel is situated opposite the beach and is within easy walking distance of all the bars etc. Or you can catch the Bahtbus. There is a wide variety of options available at breakfast. There are two pools, one of which is very long, ideal for a good swim, but it was very busy.  Wifi around the pool area was up and down. We eat dinner in Essence on arrival as we were to tired to venture out, we were the only ones in the restaurant. The staff were very attentive, we ordered local dishes, it was presented nicely and was very good.  We had drinks at the Tavern but chose not to eat there. The service was quite slow.

Absolutely stunning pool and garden area, with no shortage of loungers, individual staff were very courteous (just not enough of them). The private function we had on the Saturday night was flawless- delicious food and amazing staff. Now for the bits that put a downer on the weekend for me. If I go to a large hotel I really look forward to the breakfast, especially with friends it's always a lovely social start to the day. On the first morning we first went to the main restaurant on the third floor to be greeted by a lobby full of queuing guests. You had to give your room number to the staff and then mill around right next to people eating in the lobby area itself. Not really wanting to wait we decided to go up to the club lounge for breakfast but the situation was no better. Lots of uncleared tables, a near-empty buffet and no mugs or glasses available. After grabbing a meagre selection from the remains of the buffet (I was starving I'd been to the gym beforehand) I perched on a friends chair while we talked about what to do next. I was visiting as part of a large group which had booked in advance but really there were nowhere near enough staff to cope with the amount of guests. We decided to return back downstairs to the main restaurant and a more senior member of staff came over to speak to us, seeing how displeased we were. However when we told her that we did not expect to have to wait for a table for breakfast she flat out told us told us the hotel was busy. There was no 'sorry let me find you a table and get you a coffee' or any thing like that at all. I understand that large groups are difficult to cater for but the it was a simple understaffing issue and what got my back up was the unapologetic attitude of the management. We queued again downstairs and eventually had a lovely breakfast. The second day we went down at 8am which was a little better. On the last day we decided to go for lunch in the main restaurant before departing and I ordered a pizza. It was terrible, clearly a shop-bought pizza base and to boot a bottle of water was 150THB (about £3), I expect to pay more at a top level hotel but there's definitely a point where you feel you're being mocked. Such a shame overall because the staff were generally very nice and the outdoor area was exactly what I had expected- more even.

The check-in wasn't very smooth. The front office guys asked for a deposit of THB 3,000 which wasn't informed to me earlier and not written anywhere on my hotel voucher either. Nevertheless I obliged them with my Credit Card. It took them a good 10 minutes to get a copy of our passports.

The room offered to me was on the 6th floor and the management claims that is a ""high floor"" room as mentioned on my hotel voucher. The two things left a bad taste and I started feeling that probably I had made a wrong decision.

But once we reached the room all was forgiven and forgotten. The room is huge and I mean really huge. Amari has not differentiated between the room and the washroom and hence the size. I truly appreciate the open washroom concept and feel that it is a big highlight of this property.

The room has a small balcony from where one may enjoy the view of the swimming pool and the beach.

Full marks to the housekeeping team for their work.

Breakfast was at Essence was decent but could be better. Vegetarian options were not only limited but the food served in the buffet was cold and often out-of stock. The team surely needs to pull up their socks here.

The pool has a swim up bar and is constructed in a round shape. Enjoyed my swim and drinks here.

The location of the property is good. It might seem far away from Walking Street but at the same time it gives you peace and a noise free stay. Just flag a jeep on the main road and the driver will drop you at the Walking Street for 10 TBH per person.

I would recommend this property to fellow travelers for the location and the room. Staff members surely need to raise their level of hospitality and warmth which was clearly missing.",Ankit Biyani,?.?.-16,4,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Couple,5-Rooms,5-Cleanliness,3-Service,null,null,null

Though Pattaya is a very resort type of place, staying here is quite regular but it was a good stay nonetheless. The rooms were not that big is what I felt, it looks really big as most rooms dont have bathroom enclosures which is quite annoying personally for me. I prefer proper bathrooms rather than blinds or seperators and walk in baths.
The location is good enough as it opens up to the beach but if you would like a private hotel beach to chill at, this isn't the place. Location otherwise is great as its on the begining of Beach Road but it becomes quite a long walk to Walking Street and you have to take a cab. 
The staff were brilliant. The hotel even noticed my dad's bday on their systems and sent him a surprise cake.

However my experience last weekend was not good. Our club room was damp, so much so all my clothes were left with an awful damp smell. The hotel was very busy and there was a huge problem with understaffing. We arrived at the club lounge breakfast at around 9am and it was a total mess. There were no seats available, tables were left full of dirty dishes and not a staff member in sight. We decided to go down to the main breakfast area where we were met by huge queues and guests complaining that they had been waiting for over 30 minutes to even be seated. We came back up to the club lounge and resorted to clearing a table ourselves so we could at least sit down. The selection was pitiful and nothing was being replenished. We could not order any drinks or cooked breakfasts as the one member of staff was running around after so many other orders and the fridge had a large padlock on it! When we eventually got a small amount of food from the meager selection there was no cutlery to eat it with. 

I understand hotels have busy periods but surely they know how many guests are staying/how many rooms they have and therefore staff appropriately? This certainly didn't happen on this occasion.

We arrived weary after the long flight but as we had stayed in the Amari Garden for the last two years and decided to upgrade to the Tower we knew what to expect. We were greeted really well and made to feel important, it was about 10.30am but our room was ready for us which was very pleasing after the long flight. Reception did have my details as we had stayed at the Amari Garden several times before but there wasn't really any acknowledgement of that, as an aside we had also stayed at the Amari in Koh Samui, we like Amari hotels! On check in they take an imprint of your credit card for 12,000Bhat about £240 but cancel at the end of your holiday if you pay or don't order anything. Reception is air conditioned which helps in the heat. 

The room was excellent and the view was fabulous looking away from Pattaya and down on the pools. The room was as good as described and I particularly liked the shower, the robes and two sinks.  We did have problems with the loo but it was quickly fixed. I did note a couple of Mosquitos flying in the room which surprised me so definitely worth taking a repellant machine. There were a few plug sockets but as we have four devices to charge we always take a UK four gang extension to plug into the adapter. 
Breakfast is very good indeed, we particularly liked the honeycomb, an actual piece of honeycomb dripping honey into a pot and you could take pieces of it as well, bit disappointed there was none for our last three days though, just ordinary honey. They have most things but no porridge which I would have liked to see. Most days we had eggs and bacon but the ""extras"" of a cooked breakfast like the sausage choice was disappointing. A decent pork sausage or hash brown/potato/tomato was not available every day. Still I was not disappointed because there was a lot of other choice, like curry and oyster sauce dishes to try and cured Salmon. As very experienced travellers we are very fastidious with our insect repellant so were surprised to get bitten on the legs. We worked out by elimination that it was breakfast outside that was the likely time and when we started eating breakfast inside the bites stopped. The milk is hot rather than cold which we are used to but it didn't cause any issue. The service was excellent, the people really friendly. 
The pool area we knew from previous visits to be excellent and it still is. Towels are not a problem, no towel cards and only change twice a week nonsense, fresh clean ones are always there. One thing I did try was the pineapple juice in happy hour by the pool and very refreshing it was too even if a little expensive (around £1.10 even in Happy Hour). 
The one disappointing thing in the hotel was the wifi by the pool, in the room it was excellent but by the large pool it was unusable and most people we spoke to experienced the same. 
We were there long enough to merit a free meal in the hotels Beach road restaurant the Tavern, I can't recommend it highly enough and will write a separate review but it is worth trying, the pulled pork sandwich is better than Hard Rock! 

On our last day our pick up was 2.50pm and very helpfully they let us keep the room free of charge until 2pm giving us time to have lunch in the excellent Tavern.

Hotel is typical of a large chain..generic,  big and clean. Bedrooms good size. Location good... you have to walk a little to get the main part of beach road.

I took a hot, crazy taxi from Bangkok so the chilled out but professional welcome in the airy lobby was most welcome. After a quick check in I was shown to my room on the 7th floor.

I must say the room was really lovely. The view, although not on a very high floor, was still great. The open layout of the room was exactly to my taste and I loved the feeling of space. Bed was super comfortable and the A/C was awesome, could even get way too cold and it was so hot outside so really good. Also the abthroom was great. Not a lot of privacy so don't be shy but overall was really nice. Plus a balcony to chill on so even better!

I had a few issues with housekeeping on my trip. Not the quality of the cleaning which was fantastic, just some of the timings of when they actually serviced the room and how they fit around my comings and goings. This was no big deal in the end and dealt with really well by staff at the hotel when I mentioned it, especially one of the guest relations girls who was really, really lovely! When I have stayed in 5 star hotels before one of the magical things they seem to be able to do is predict your routine almost as soon as you get there, and the best hotels only need you out of the room for a quick 30 minute swim and seem to swoop in and clean at no inconvenience to you as a guest. I think this could do with some work at the Amari.

Common areas of the hotel such as pool, bar areas, tavern by the sea, lobby bar etc. really are fantastic and were truly good places to be. These were made even better by the consistently fantastic and well trained staff around the hotel who were so and friendly at every turn.

Location is also good. Pattaya is so easy to get around and if you want to walk down beach road, there is some great things to see as it turns from a relatively quiet promenade at the northern Amari end, to a raucous street party full of world tourists and working girls down at the South end.

Overall I had a brilliant 12 days at the hotel and will definitely stay again in the future. I would recommend Amari Ocean Pattaya to anyone who asks. You should stay here if you get chance.",Tom M,?.?.-15,5,"Pattaya, Thailand",Solo,5-Value,5-Service,5-Sleep Quality,null,null,null

We have never stayed here before and we booked for 4 days (which I later further extended by 2 days).  We found management and staff at the resort extremely friendly, courteous and obliging at all times

This resort is in a great location and we were in what would be a standard but fantastic super modern luxurious suite.  Bath, separate shower, separate toilet and all appliances worked perfectly, plenty of floor space, ample power points and lighting that could be switched to suit any mood.  We had an awesome view of the ocean and Naklua district from our room and balcony on the 17th floor. Free internet was also included.  In all, this accommodation is very highly recommended.

In the resort, the garden, lawn and pool areas are impeccable with comfortable sunchairs everywhere, never a problem getting one.  Believe it or not you do NOT have to trade towel vouchers here at this resort to get a towel like at many other 5 star resorts (obviously implying otherwise you would steal them), the towels here are freely and readily accessible from towel hampers located around the pool areas.  When you are finished, you just drop the towel to the hamper marked “used”

During check-in, do not get confused with the Amari Garden resort which is on the same plot and shares the same outdoor facilities, this complex is not high rise and to me looked like fairly dated accommodation.  The Amari Ocean is the relatively new high rise building equipped with four fast, modern and spacious lifts serving the building.  Check-in for the Amari Ocean is from the foyer at the base of this building.  We made the mistake of trying to check-in at the Amari Garden, but were pleasantly escorted by staff (driven by cart) to the Amari Ocean reception area a few hundred metres away.

We found the resort location is away from all the noise and disturbances typical of Pattaya lifestyle, yet very central. When leaving the resort we walked out the exit directly opposite the beach onto Beach Road.  If we did not feel like walking, we caught a 10 Baht bus ride that could take us as far as Walking Street and beyond up to Second Road, South Pattaya if so desired.

Coming back to the resort, we caught a Baht bus on Second Road that in most cases took us to the beginning of Beach Road near the Dolphin roundabout.  If not, we just got off at the start of Naklua Road (close to entrance to Dusit resort).  From either location we just walked down a hundred meters to the other entrance into the resort (opposite the Dusit resort).  This suited us fine as we could always stock up with a few grocery items on our way from the convenience store located just outside the resort

Note that there are numerous places to dine at, all within easy walking distance from the resort, whether it be, Beach Road, Naklua Road or Second Road

In closing, all I can say is that I would not have been disappointed if we had to pay full price for this luxurious accommodation.  Compared to other 5 star hotels we have just recently stayed at, this one would have been worth every cent!

Family of 4, 2 adults, a 8 and 2 years old boys. Given room on 8th floor. Unfortunately it was city view and not sea view. 
We requested for late checked out at 2pm, can be till 4pm, but subject to availability.
King size bed comfortably accommodated perfectly for hubby and me and our 2 years old. 8 years old slept on bunker bed.
Room was big for both boys to play with their toys. But, the pillow were very thin... not my type. Hubby found that mattress too soft.
Huge bathroom, nice little balcony where you could hang out wet swimming costumes, balcony faced Holiday Inn hotel. 
Had a few meals at Essence, the main cafe. Our 8 year boy loved the kid's menu, esp ""Bangers and Mash"". He had it thrice!😋 I had twice the sweet and sour fish, delicious, another time, the sweet and sour pork. Me and my 2 years old LOVE it on steaming hot rice. Yummy. Hubby loved the different types od noodles on the menu. Wasn't that expensive, slightly 15%- 20% more than those we patronized along Beach Road. Definitely tastier than some.
Poolside was fun for the boys, not crowded, do try the different smoothies they served.
A big Thank You to the F&B staff at poolside and Essence. Very attentive, friendly and warm. Thumbs up !!!
Housekeeping too, they did a wonderful job too! 
Overall highly recommended to family with kids, especially the huge space, approx 64 sq m, I think. Bunker bed is great, at the corner of room.

The staff are wonderful, more like true friends rather than employees.  There has been a recent change in management and the introduction of new policies with regard to the little extras regulars guests have grown to expect.  We ourselves are more than happy with the standard of the rooms/care and restaurants on site, and still consider it good value for money, other guests are perhaps not as willing to accept these changes.  However starting in May 2017 the hotel is to start major reconstruction work which will entail the demolition of the Garden  Room accommodations with a view to building a new tower block, along with a gym and spa complex.  There are plans to build another adult swimming pool and redesign the pool bar  swimming pool into a safe area for children to play and swim.  
I am sure the final results will be fabulous, but, we ourselves cannot face the disruption that will be inevitable during the transition period.  It is expected that the new accommodation will not be ready until 2020 taking approx two and half years to complete.  
Although I wish the hotel and staff well during this time, I do feel it is only fair to warn potential holiday makers that some noise etc will be inevitable.

We were lucky enough to have the corner room with a 180 degree panoramic view of the beach. The view is gorgeous, as you can see the entire beach, and the room was spacious and clean. We also had access to the executive floor (19th floor, Horizon Club Lounge), which provides breakfast, snacks for 24 hours, and happy hour from 5:30-7:30, and that's where we ate most of our meals.
For ""happy hour"", you have to be dressed ""smart casual"" so my friend and I were told to go change our shoes since we were wearing flip flops. We were okay with that, however, when we came back, we saw other adults in flip flops and sandals, and the staff didn't get mad at them, when sandals were also on the list of banned attire. I'm not sure if it was because we are teenagers or not, but I found it rather bizarre and semi-ridiculous that my friend had to wear old torn up sneakers with a dress instead of flip flops, while other guests were permitted with their footwear. 
However, all the staff were super friendly and helpful, and didn't frown at me when I kept going back for more food. They also have good room etiquette, and the maid wouldn't clean our room because we left our safe open when leaving the room (they take that very seriously because they do not want to be responsible for any lost items). 
The hotel is right across from the beach, has two pools, a small gym, and is a short walk from Art Paradise (an art museum you should check out). We also ordered room service which was fast and timely. There's also free wi-fi in the room!

One tip:
If you can stay away from the metered taxis in Pattaya. On check out I was going to the Hard Rock hotel to meet a friend from where we were getting a taxi back to Bangkok. The bellboys called for a meter taxi to take me there but when they pulled up they quoted me 200 baht and had no intention of using the meter as it would only have been about 50 baht.

Staff on Horizon Club floor is good on service but not excellent, should immediate come to customer when customer step into club. 
For overall staff at Hotel, especially Essence restaurant, In my opinion they did not care much on Thai Customer, this is my 4th time  but it is my 1st time that I was asked for coffee or Tea at Essence 😓
Breakfast at Essence is very less compare to volume of customer also less of variation. Most of food is vegetarian for indian and pork for other. But I am muslim so ..... . You should increase the variety of food more than this, may observe from Amari Phuket on the variation.

As part of our summer break in Thailand, we have, once again, returned to the Amari Ocean.  As much as we like to experience new areas, new hotels and meet new people, we keep returning here for our Amari fix!
Check in was swiftly taken care of in 'The Club' over a cold drink and the welcome ice cold towel.  As always the club is a haven to take refreshments and the 'Happy Hour' is not to be missed. Our grateful thanks to Tukta, Doll, Am, Nan, Nana and the Club staff for taking such good care of us!
Our room was, as expected, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean.  The housekeeping team kept it this way throughout our stay.  The team ensure that you want for nothing! Fresh towels twice daily if required and clean sheets too...
Although as Club members you can breakfast in the Club, we ate breakfast mostly in Essence.  A huge variety of food to tempt even the fussiest palette! From Indian curries to Thai noodles, Sushi, dim sum, a British 'fry up', continental meats or cheeses, cakes, croissants, pancakes, waffles...the list is endless.  If anyone leaves hungry, it is definitely by choice!  A special mention must go to the staff in Essence....service with a smile from Gun, Prime, O, Wi, Lila and I'm sorry if I haven't mentioned everyone of the fabulous staff!
Often meeting friends for 'happy hour' (or two) and meals at The Tavern, it soon became somewhat of a nightly ritual.  Cold beer, air conditioned comfort (or open air fans) and the choice of sporting fixtures or the resident duo.  A great way to wile away a couple of hours after sight seeing or the hard work of lounging by the pool!  The staff knew your favourite tipple and ensured that the glass was rarely empty for long...thanks to Noi, Maha, Ae, Tang and the team!
The pool areas is large enough to enjoy the pools or jacuzzi in the blistering heat.  Plenty of sun beds , and very little sun bed  reserving thanks to the staff ensuring that sun  beds  are not reserved but unoccupied for hours! The pool staff will assist you wherever possible...cold drinks, delicious food or putting up your parasol.   Fresh towels are readily available, and you can swap then as and when you want...saves on valuable luggage space and weight leaving more space for the spoils of my shopping trips!  The noodle soup, served from the cart poolside is absolutely delicious and a very reasonable 100-130 Bahts depending on your chosen accompaniment (chicken, pork or shrimp). A must try - either served to your sun bed, or eaten at the 'dining area'.
Ever present (and highly visible) are the management team: Brendan, Richard, Jib and Dan, again ensuring that everyone is happy.  I'm sure that, should I have experienced any difficulties or problems they would have been resolved as soon as humanly possible, and to our satisfaction.

Pattaya - being the closest city made it an easy choice.  Lets start with the location. The hotel isn't location in the beach. It's across the street just like most...if not all the hotels in Pattaya. In my opinion, it is the perfect location since it's close enough to the action yet far enough away so you can have a nice quiet sleep. 
The staff was nice but something about the experience was a little off. They weren't rude by any means but being the third hotel I have experienced in Thailand it was definitely not as welcoming and as well trained as others. So - just ok when it came to front desk and pool staff. 
The pool area was a nice surprise. Nice size pool with a pool bar and very chill. Servers also around for food and drinks. 
UPGRADE TO OCEANFRONT!! Period. I paid an extra $40 per night and had an amazing view of the ocean. As soon as I entered the room I was thinking of extending my stay. it's really that nice. The bed was comfortable and I really liked the open bath design of the room.  After a few hours when i was used to the view I did notice some stains on the curtains and inside the shower the calking was discolored and just looked odd. These issues aren't major at all and with the value of the hotel I would 100% overlook.  My friend was in another room and told me it was one of the nicest rooms he has ever been in so maybe I am a hotel snob:) 
All in all, If i ever returned to Pattaya I would stay here again. BUT, I can say I will never come back to this city. The ocean is too polluted to swim in and the main downtown attraction ""walking street"" was just not my thing and a little too ""in your face"" for my taste if you know what I mean.",iscreenwriter,?.?.-16,4,"San Francisco, California",Friends,5-Location,4-Cleanliness,3-Service,null,null,null

I used to be a Dusit customer, but due to all the goodies Amari offers, I switched to here.
Oh not to forget the free, reasonably fast internet.
Tip to management : you should offer the possibility to only have to log on to your internet once, for the entire stay.

The Amari Garden is gone with its resort style charm to be replaced by........ Checked into Amari  Ocean. The friendliness and welcoming nature which one associated with the earlier avatar is totally gone. The reception desk is downright rude as if they are doing you a favour letting you in to the hotel. And can you best this: there were numerous people waiting in the lounge to be allotted rooms , for some reason even though most of their guests check out at around 10 they still will not checkin before 2 pm. The icing on the cake is that there were staff going all around the lobby remonstrating all the weary travellers to sit properly and straight in the seats lest the decorum of the property is disturbed. Well give them the rooms on time and get them out of the lounge I say.  
The hotel is wearing down at the edges. The carpets are running threadbare , the rooms while huge in size are not well maintained any longer. Light switches don't work, or are broken in some cases, bedsheets with tears in them, and showers which are stuck in hot or cold mode.  These are problems one does not associate with 5 star properties.  As such till it opens anew I suggest they downgrade to 3 star and drop prices accordingly thereby deliver more value for money. 
The much famed Amari  breakfast was nothing much to talk about and the restaurant is woefully small for their size of property and as a result one might have to wait up to 30 minutes to be seated.

They have a very large pool and can be accessed from the restaurant , set amidst a garden.Also the garden wing of the hotel is located across the pool.The pool side outlet offers you nice cocktails.Playing facilities like shuttle , table tennis are there.

Excellent staff: always ready to help and go the extra mile to ensure that guests are looked after. The restaurant staff were excellent, always refilling our coffee and supplying our chosen breakfast requirements.  Staff in the Tavern by the Sea, poolside, reception, housekeeping, security - all superb...Fabulous customer service.  The GM Brendan, the F and B manager Dan and many senior staff can be seen around the hotel checking that guests are happy. Each and everyone of them stopping to pass the time of day and to enquire if everything was to our satisfaction. While we were there we celebrated a birthday and anniversary.  The staff went out of their way to ensure we had a fabulous day, even bringing a birthday cake around the pool and singing 'Happy Birthday'.
Check in: fast, professional and courteous.  Four couples (plus two young children) arrived after 10pm, we were given cold towels and drinks, and the whole process took about 10 minutes maximum. Room keys and complimentary internet passwords given, and off to the room.  Our bags arrived almost as we got to the room...faultless.
Location:  right on Beach Road...easy access to all areas of Pattaya.  Close enough for easy access, but far enough away from the 'madness' should you want complete relaxation.  The grounds and pools are well maintained and just what is needed in 90 degree heat...cold towels and fruit around the pool a welcome treat!
Rooms: large and spacious, our Tower room had everything we needed for a great stay.  Housekeeping was efficient, and the room was always cleaned to a high specification.  Plenty of storage, high water pressure meant that the shower was powerful. Thoughtful touches - bathrobe, slippers, tea and coffee making facilities plus a beach/pool  bag for your convenience...even an umbrella just in case!
Food: the breakfasts are far superior to any hotel in the area...exceptional choice, fresh ingredients, and once again attentive staff.  The food around the pool is a little more expensive than outside, but you pay for the convenience of not having to leave the sun lounger!  The Tavern by the Sea is a great place to enjoy one of the Speciality Nights.  The Churrasco night was superb, with free flow meat and seafood, together with salads and deserts...yummy!  The ribs and wing night was also a favourite!  The regular menu was also quite extensive offering a wide range of different meals...the beef and chicken fajitas delicious!
We come to Thailand for the great weather, excellent food and great hospitality..all of which we enjoy at the Amari Ocean.  A great haven for relaxing and enjoying Pattaya.

Stupid question ;), not so stupid as to not stay here longer when we had the chance, I can honestly say that both myself and my partner have not just enjoyed but thoroughly enjoyed the Amari Ocean View.
There are 2 wings to the Amari in Pattaya, the Garden Wing & the Ocean Wing, we have stayed in the Ocean Wing on the Executive Level (do it, you'll be glad you did), the room is very well designed, with both shower & bath & balcony, the bed is ultra comfortable and being just one floor from the Executive lounge incredibly convenient (the other two Exec floors are either on the same level as the lounge or 1 floor above so ALL exec lounge floors are very close to the lounge in this respect). 
The pool area is just a short lift ride away and is not only spacious but DEEP, I should also mention the other pool (which we did not use) appears to be Olympic (50m) size so swimming laps should not be a problem. Another thing I should mention is that someone went to Vegas and took lessons from the hotels there about pool service, a circling waiter (& to think about it I never saw a waitress) is never far away to take your dirink/food order (club sandwich & Ceasar Salad are very good) + there are two happy hours poolside daily (11.30 - 12.30 & 16.00 - 17.00) 1/2 price or two for one.
The lounge has breakfast in the morning (07.00 - 10.30) with a very good range to choose from + eggs cooked to order (offsite) & delivered to you, snacks & soda/coffee during the day & then complimentary drinks (alcoholic) & canapes from 17.30 - 19.30, the snacks/canapes are fantastic, really restaurant standard & being the piggy that I am, you can eat more than enough that you don't really need dinner afterwards ;). i LOVE the snacky type things they did but the rice paper rolls with rare beef were AMAZING, throw in JD & Coke and you had to pry me out with a jackhammer.
In short we loved the Amari, my other 1/2 had stayed at the Amari in Bangkok but me, I just booked it over the net going on Trip Advisor ratings, best thing I did according to the other 1/2, mega brownie points for me ;)
Its also in North Pattaya which means its out of the action (or malestrom depending on your point of view) that Pattaya is known for, if you want that, just jump on the baht bus out the front on Beach Rd and your there in 15 or so minutes.
This is the perfect place to stay for those wanting a bit more than normal but still within reach of all that Pattaya has to offer, I hate to rave, but seriously we couldn't be happier, hence the title.",MrBuff,?.?.-14,5,Penang,Couple,5-Rooms,5-Service,5-Sleep Quality,null,null,null

i'm not saying it's a horrid hotel. But it's certainly not good value and i hardly feel any hospitality that i deserve as a guest. The lobby itself wasn't huge, checkin was slow and painful so it gets worse when you have no place to sit and hang out while waiting for your room to be ready 2 hours later. For the record we felt the occupancy wasn't great when we visited.
To start with, a lack of a ""survival guide""  for pattaya made our trip very confusing. We're expected to know how to get around town and what to expect. Amari's location is not splendid. (Unlike hotels in the Naklua area, there is a lack of street stalls outside the Hotel), you have to walk all the way around the compound to find the food stalls at chinatown and a minimart. You're sort of forced to visit the Hotel restaurant or the restaurants nearby. (we only got to know this by chance when a driver drove us out). You have to get out of the main gate, and then U-turn into holiday inn to walk to chinatown and central marina mall. We were bewildered why a property as huge as Amari had no direct access to the local malls.
The entire area was under ""renovation"". When they mean renovation, (1) a new enormous shopping complex is bring built behind the Hotel, (2) the beachfront in front of the ""beachfront"" Hotel was closed and barricaded, and (3) three of the five buildings within the Hotel complex was being TORN DOWN. The constant pounding meant there was absolutely no peace in the room and in the pool. Pattaya is the sort of place where people rested in the day and head out at night for fun. Yeah seriously.
The room is fine, apart from the shower (both handheld and rain shower) being lack lustre and some furniture looking tired. The bedroom rug slips around and there is no Master switch to turn off the lights. The saving grace is the huge bathtub in an open setting, a sea view from the large window and the toilet, which you can see out of. 
However, we also note that there is no solar film on the windows, so not only can everyone see you when you look out of the window, the room takes a long time to cool at night. We were also baffled why the Hotel did not bother to face all beds towards the sea. Some rooms did and others had beds that backfaced the sea. We peeked through some open doors and see that the non seaview rooms looked directly towards into holiday inn.
The buffet breakfast was a spread but nothing was their specialty. The thai food were not fantastic, though they could make the challenging egg dishes we wanted (my eggs benedict looked the part at least). The japanese section had no rice (seriously) and no dishes, just condiments. We stayed 4 nights and were bored out by the second day. A funky make your own pancakes machine that you can watch how the pancake is made kept us entertained on the first day. I felt the Hotel has overstretched itself in this respect.
Some staff would walk behind your table and take your empty place away without asking. At other times the housekeeping staff were not aware that we're out and did not do the housekeeping, we had to tell her to do so when we went out. Along many there were some simple courtesies expected in a western style Hotel which were lacking. Some nights you get 2 teabags in the room while on another there were 4. There was a notepad with no pen on the first night.
To get to the pool you have to walk down the stairs from the restaurant. The entrance from the restaurant to the pool was not blocked so if you walk through the restaurant you get a telling off from the staff. They should have barricaded the pool/restaurant door so guests would know. I also felt insecure at the pool, anyone could walk up from the driveway (very nearby) and leave with your belongings. The pool design was very funny and dangerous. At one end it's below a metre and halfway through it goes deeper than an olympic pool at 2.5m. It also had the weakest waterfall feature i've ever witnessed in all the hotels i ever stayed. Bar staff in the pool were accomodating though. 
The gym was another saving grace. It's not particularly attractive and the equipment were dated. But it was quiet, and conducive. For some reason towels were always absent and sparse. 
In all, I did not feel my stay was peaceful and did not feel welcomed. Being the first time in pattaya and the first place that i visited in pattaya, I was left with poor impressions of the city and of the Amari brand. If not for my good orientation skills,  I would have hated pattaya to the core.",Heng H,??.?.-17,3,"Singapore, Singapore",Couple,null,null,null,null,null,null

As we were staying in a junior suite we had use of the executive lounge which we enjoyed. The breakfast menu whilst less than the main restaurant was more than sufficient and was much less busy.  We also enjoyed happy hour with free drinks and snacks for 2 hours each night. 
Our junior suite had panoramic views over Pattaya bay so had a fabulous view even when laying down on the bed which was really cool!
The rooms as well equipped with all the usual items you would expect including tea and coffee.
We did find the bed hard so after a couple of attempts we did manage to get a topper on the bed which made a massive difference and then the bed was more comfy.
The maid service was excellent with towels changed regularly and bottles of water replenished.
Staff were overall first class and especially in the executive lounge and in particular April who served us most evenings with drinks.
The pool is also lovely and we also enjoyed having meals by the pool as well. I enjoyed the pad thai regularly here. I was not so keen on the pizza as this was pretty dry.
We also had some spa treatments and once again they were excellent, especially the tea and macaroons served afterwards.
Easy enough to get around on the baht buses which come past every few seconds virtually.
My only slight negatives and these did not stop our enjoyment significantly but are worth mentioning are that the area where we sat by the pool was near some trees and there was a number of birds who lived in these trees and therefore bird poo was inevitable and this cold have done with being cleaned up more regularly ad washed down.
The only other negative was not the hotel fault but there was a noisy family with 2 toddlers who were unacceptably noisy in the executive lounge during happy hour for a couple of nights.  I suspect that as the manager was off for a few days the other staff were not keen on reminding them that it is unacceptable to have screaming/crying children in the executive lounge running around.  It was a case that the children were clearly tired but the parents so keen to make use of the happy hour that they ignored the needs of their children.

The room is spacious, clean, light, with free wifi.
With the Horizon Club, there are complimentary food and beverages all day, with cocktail every night (17h30/19h30). Lot of customers enjoy their “dinner” during this cocktail hours…Be aware to respect the attire policy when you access to the Club because otherwise, you had to change your clothes. In my opinion, it’s a shame to ask customers to respect the smart casual attire because when we are on vacation, we definitively want to relax…
The staff was polite and friendly, especially at the lobby, SPA and concierge.
Housekeeping very slow. Fitness room very small and not well appointed.
Two large swimming pools (one noisy with children pool and another one quieter) and plenty of place for sunbathing.
The hotel is located at the North end of Pattaya (peaceful place). We can reach the central Pattaya within a few minutes walk or take a tuk tuk (THB 10 per person).

The beds are 7ft by 7ft and very very comfortable. View were side on and you could see the sea from most rooms I suspect. The only downside for us was that although there was a wooden blind shielding the bathroom from the bedroom if you're using the toilet facilities you do feel a bit vulnerable (there's also no locks on the shower or toilet door and the toilet door has obscured glass). Pool is lovely and there were activities to do, heat permitting! One criticism which I relayed on this site when we were at the Amari in Hua Hin last year was that the drinks are expensive by the pool and they charge 50thb for ice! Eg non alcoholic drinks are four times the price you can get a can for in the shop on the corner. From memory it's about 180 thb. The tuk tuk to town was 20 thb each. We ate in Hooters a couple of times and although it was, on both occasions, the most expensive meals we had, the portions are really good for the men and the girls parading around are not over the top like further down towards walking street or in the go go bars.

I've stayed in a few of the Amari hotels (Koh Samui, Phuket and Bangkok) and they are worth the money and guaranteed exceptional service.
The hotel was undergoing construction and we had an issue with the room we booked, which was quickly resolved and extremely happy with how they handled it and upgraded us. We had booked an Executive room with sea view and ended up with duplex suite - absolutely amazing. As we'd booked an Executive room, we had access to the Executive floor (only people staying in the Executive rooms had access to this floor) which had the benefit of its own restaurant and from 17:00 - 19:00 they had an exquisite buffet and any drinks you wished for to help yourself to. It was extremely lovely. 
We ate breakfast in the main restaurant as there seemed more choice and catered more for us. I wanted avocado one day and asked if they had this, 10 minutes later they came out with some. Also I like hot water and lemon in the mornings and every morning when we got seated, the staff knew and asked if I wanted this - so attentive. 
All throughout the holiday we got friendly with the staff (hard not to) and they went out of their way to make conversation with us and make sure everything was ok. 
The pool area is delightful, albeit you don't seem to get much sun (which is no fault of the hotel). They are building an additional pool which we were told will be better positioned for the sun. 
The location is good, at the quiet end and a short walk to the restaurants/bars. Across the road is the beach. 
I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if I was to come back to Pattaya, and I'd certainly stay in an Amari hotel (as I have done so). Amazing hotel - 5 stars.",Samantha B,?.?.-17,5,"London, United Kingdom",Couple,5-Rooms,5-Cleanliness,5-Service,null,null,null

The check-in was speedy, on the 19th floor. On arrival we were served excellent welcome drinks and wet fresh towels. 
The room that we checked in was a junior suite room. There was excellent WiFi in the room. 
But then, I was surprised to see a tub in the room itself. How would I adjust with the kids? But then I realized that there was a wooden curtain in the room. Both the kids enjoyed themselves to the fullest. The hotel room was the main attraction for the kids. They wanted to be in the room all the time. It was a new experience for them altogether to have a bath, watch television, have snacks in one go...LOL. 
The hotel breakfast was superb! Very well spread and I think everything I could think of in a European breakfast was served. Free snacks and drinks could be had any time of the day. The staff was so accommodating, that they gave us a plastic box and told us to pack breakfast for my younger daughter as children generally do not eat early in the morning. We were also given juice tins, cold drinks and water for the beach.  
The extra service was the hotel are also very well to be appreciated about. I booked a online tour and wanted a print out. I contacted 6655 for a printout and Miss Chunlika.k was knocking at my door after a minute of the phone call with the printouts!!! She even unlocked my locker with a smile. Later I was sent jam cookies for the children. 
The service of the hotel was better than I expected. Free lime and salt was sent to my room, whenever I demanded.

In 2014 during my first visit, I was told by one of my friend to stay in Amari Phuket and Amari Watergate Bangkok. Loved each minute of my stay in these properties. 
This month, I along with my family planned another trip to Thailand, this time Pattaya and Bangkok and chose to stay in no other property than Amari. It just gives you a sense of relief - as if everything is taken care of by them. Amari is very well known for its location and in Pattaya this hotel is situated in perfect place on the Beach road. Our room was on the main tower with breathtaking ocean view. With huge King size bed we could easily accommodate our little children with us, although a separate baby cot was also provided without any extra charge for our 1 year boy. 
Just by crossing the road you have access to the beach with all sort of activities like Para-sailing, speedboats and of-course the sweet and chilled coconut water. Inside the hotel also there are many activities to keep your little ones busy. Apart from number of swimming pools, the kids room and kids activity areas are there where kids can enjoy by themselves. 
Access to main shopping areas like Mike’s Mall and Central Festival Mall is very easy through tuk-tuk. These are pick-up trucks with sitting at the back where you can sit and ring the bell to get down anywhere you like for the price of 10 BHT per person only. Since I was traveling with my family, this hotel proved to be a very sensible choice as it was located right on the beach road without any transportation problems. 
The food in the hotel is exceptionally good with huge servings and very well priced compared to 5 star hotels in India. Mantra restaurant is highly recommended with 7 to 8 live kitchens of different cuisines. It took us a while to decide what to eat – do try Duck & Lamb dish (attached pic) and Mantra’s specialty Dessert (attached pic). 
Tavern restaurant is on the main road facing beach with live music. Loved the setting and the way everything is done. The kids loved the Chicken Tikka Masala with Garlic Naan. Also the coffee shop where we had regular buffet breakfast had huge selection with the choice of Indian food as well. 
To conclude, I am in love with Thailand – beautiful country, beautiful people and on top of it the amazing hotels and staff to take care of you. Thanks to all the staff, especially Ms. Sarah, Manager (PR) at Amari to make our trip so special & memorable.",Rattan S,??.?.-16,5,"New Delhi, India",Family,5-Cleanliness,5-Service,5-Sleep Quality,null,null,null

It was a far cry from the pictures on the hotel website & the reception staff though actually asked me to show him the image on the website! Its hard to imagine that the hotel staff is unaware of the images posted on the website. Of course, after seeing the picture he offered to change our room & even upgrade us but the rooms just didn't make the cut.
We were booked for 2 nights but checked out after sending a night. Since we had to move our luggage my wife requested the concierge/ bell desk to call for a taxi & he refused saying that we could either use the hotel car (at a huge premium obviously) else hail a cab from the main road! To worsen matters he told her he would call a cab but the charge would be 200 Baht to go to Dusit Thani Hotel barely 300 meters away. The taxis in Pattaya are not metered but for such a distance the maximum charge is 100 Baht. The nexus between the hotel staff & the taxi drivers was more than obvious.

the breakfast is a must where you can find variety of culinary items varying from European Asian and middle eastern with Thai and far east experience.
Your requests whatever the are handled promptly.
Checking in is great experience with a cold welcome drink.
There are two pools attached to this fine hotel, One with a pool bar and the other is for a long swim and bubble swim.
Tom Yum Soup by the pool is a must to try, and don't forget the happy hour where two for one is a must.
Relaxing in your room with spectacular views are few minor this to mention

There is an outstanding (although expensive) restaurant on the hotel grounds called Mantra, which is well worth a visit. Breakfast is good, but not outstanding. It seems like this hotel hosts mainly indian, chinese and japanese guests and for this reason has a little bit of indian, chinese, japanese, thai and western food. Except for the thai food, nothing really stands out. There are 2 beautiful swimmingpools, one oriented to children and the other for free swimming. 
The hotel is at the beginning of Beach Road at the complete other end of Walking Street. If nightlife is your thing, there are better hotels locationwise. 
As mentioned, there were many Indian guests in the hotel. We had problems on 3 of our 5 nights there because of loud noise, yelling and partying. This large group occupied a row of 5 rooms in the same hallway and were completely ignorant of other guests. On 2 occasions we called the frontdesk to intervene. Once at 4.30 AM we politely asked if they could lower the noise only to be shown the middlefinger. One night at 4 AM there was yelling because of some altercation with 2 prostitutes. We asked for other rooms, but since we needed connecting rooms this wasn't possible.

The beach can be seen from the balcony but from an angle. The bathroom is also huge with a bathtub, a shower compartment, a WC compartment and 2 wash hand basins.

The room is not toddler friendly. My toddler son has knocked his head onto the glass study table top a few times, but was lucky not to get any cuts.

As a family it was the best decision and the hotel became my kids fav. We booked the executive club room as it was on the higher floors because we wanted a beach view and we were not disappointed... It looked amazing! You have other perks as well if you book the executive club like access to the horizon club for a cup of coffee or a little bit of snack enjoying the beautiful viewfrom the club.The breakfast brought a smile on our faces as it had a couple of indian dishes like aloo paratha and puri with some curry plus most of the items were halal..we even confirmed the oil used and it was 100% vegetable oil... So we felt very comfortable to have breakfast which had most halal items. The swimming pools were great....kids had an amazing time! We just had problem with our wifi... It was pretty slow and sometimes wouldn't work in our room...but worked fine if you are sitting in the horizon club. Overall an excellent experience and we will definitely come back to Amari ocean on our next trip to Pattaya!
Room tips:- 1. go for the corner rooms which are closer to the beach for a better view.

Cant fault the suite, which overlooks the ocean, clean and well stocked at all times.
The club lounge and breakfast was good, and serving staff excellent.
Outside the pool area and bar was very welcoming on the hot days....again minor complaint the pool was at bath temperature....we would have preferred cooler water on such hot humid days, which we had.

==========
THE BEAUTIFUL AND CONVENIENT LOCATION... You are in the centre of almost everything you need... Located on the Beach Road itself and very close to the Dolphin Round About, which ensures that you are close to everything you need... talk of super markets, restaurants (being an Indian - I was happy to have Indian Restaurant close by). Al Cazer / Tiffany show are very much at a Walking Distance. If one wish to explore Walking Street and other night life the same is easily accessible with Tuk-Tuks by paying just 10 Bahts.
The Hotel Property
==================
Basically the Hotel Property has two Wings... Both are connected but the one with the entrance close to Doplin Round About is under renovation and surprisingly it never created any troubles during our stay. Overall the property is beautiful with ample parking place, lawns and pool. The Lobby and Waiting area are beautiful and neatly done with nice interiors...
Rooms
======
Superb rooms that's what I can say... Our initial booking was for a Deluxe Room with the occupancy of 4 (Me, My wife and 2 kids)... But, at the time of check in the beautiful lovely lady at the Check in Desk offered us the Family Suite with Bunk Bed Option which made our stay more comfortable. The Bathrooms were spacious and well designed with Bath Tub at one side, Dry Area and Commode in the middle and Shower on the other side. Rooms had every comfort and the required things you need during your stay...
Swimming Pool
=============
A beautiful long pool to enjoy or relax. The pool bar ensure to take care of your drink needs...
Food
====
Lovely Food for Breakfast... I was more than happy to see a couple of Indian Dishes. The different varieties and options provided for the breakfast and keeping in mind the influx of more of Chinese and Indian people, the options were provided for a multi national menu...
The staff / Hotel People 
=================
The Nice people and hotel staff to assist you at each step... The front Desk, Check In, Check Out Counters and Room Service and the Other staff; All of them were happy to assist and comfort you at each stage.

The room we had was large but in an awkward design. However, the views were excellent. The room finishing was not really anything to rave about. Functional though.
Room service was good, I always test how good a chef is at room service if they could cook a nice fried rice and hot cup of chocolate with little sugar. Most cannot make it right as the person ordering and preparing are two different individuals. It came out right for me as a late night supper.
Had a good night's sleep. The bed was good. The layout of the bathroom, toilet and its toiletries was a bit confusing. The lighting switches was a bit of a major project. It took me several attempts at switching to know which controlled which. I believe the hotel management should fix this with master switch.  Small issue but major for a guest.
I asked to change to another room as there was a few issues as I had gotten a room that was a Junior Suite Club Ocean View with Breakfast and they fixed it at the club floor reception.
Breakfast at the club floor was way below par and expectations. Firstly the staff were too busy and had at the material time only 3 persons. Getting a clean table and service was a 5 minute endeavour. By the time I got my seat, the waiter/ress were slow and had to wait further to get the table cleared up and cutlery placed. Then the next issue kicked in. Inferior club floor tables and cheap chairs. Cleanliness in the club floor was the other. Food debris on the floor and some chairs were not cleaned properly and it stained my pants. 
I had a very inexperience male staff who was a bit rude when asked him to find me another seat. This was quickly calmed down by a female supervisor at the time. 
As a gesture of good hospitality the supervisor upgraded me to to the Duplex Suite which was what I was trying to book online but not able to do so. This made my day and the rest of my stay there.
I will say that this hotel has a very good outdoor and function catering team that is very good. However the staff preparing breakfast in the club floor and restaurants have to buck up and meet expectations.
The only other setback here is the lack of covered or indoor parking. Stuff gets pretty hot inside the car when parked overnight or all day under the sun. The management should address this issue.",Leonard F,?.?.-15,4,"Bangkok, Thailand",Business,4-Rooms,3-Service,5-Sleep Quality,null,null,null

However my husband and I decided to get away for a few days without the children for my birthday and we chose here as it was a considerably  cheaper option. 
In short wish we tried here years ago. We will definitely be back.
Room fantastic I am fairly easily pleased however I won't for go my sea view. Fabulous view of the ocean, beaches, the mountains, the sanctuary of truth and the North end of Pattaya and so so quiet to!
The open plan room was clean and exceptionally spacious and a bath with a view a first for me. His and hers sinks although I refused to use the scales, bed was comfy and A/C brilliant. Mini bar reasonably priced.
Being very sun intolerant there were plenty of shaded structures to laze away the hours by the pool with no worry of being sunburnt. Pools were lovely and the Jacuzzi to.
What's more I was pleasantly surprised by the drinks and food prices. On many other holidays we have left the sanctuary of the pool to find drinks choosing not to pay the hotel prices. Here we didn't have to do that and with Happy Hour between 11-12 and 3-4 a family of 4 could quench there thirst quite reasonably. The food is good value to. I would highly recommend the Sea Bass Burger. (If you have room from your breakfast).
Breakfast offers a lot of choice, the staff were polite and helpful, remembered our room number and on one occasion when the hotel was exceptionally busy tables were allocated quickly and efficiently ensuring people were seated in order of their arrival at the restaurant.

The hotel was modern with great facilities. You can have as many towels as you like for the huge swimming pools and pool with massage water jets. Fruit skewers delivered free to you whilst at the pool. Great 2-4-1 offers on spa treatments if you want something more upmarket than a cheap street massage. Lots of choice at breakfast buffet (even if curry smell a bit strong!) Bar in the pool for nice iced coffees and cocktails (but they were a bit weak). Late check out at 2pm was allowed. I was also allowed to have the straw beach bag as a treat. We paid extra for the ocean view which was a good idea. 
There's also activities if you want - yoga, water aerobics which looked fun, but we didn't get involved. 
Downsides I would say were that the cleaning service wasn't always very prompt and there were a few ""weevils"" in our room 1506 so probably needs a deep clean. Also the other clientele were a bit so-so.
Hotel car was 3500 baht back to Bangkok so we walked down to the street and got a taxi from the rank outside The Tavern and it was 1500 baht. 
Lots of little shops nearby such as Family Mart where we stocked up with wine, tea and milk, snacks etc to enjoy on the balcony !
We didn't go to Pattaya for the (awful) night life - we just wanted to relax - I would recommend the Glasshouse and Sugar Hut for nice dinners which are 30 mins and 15 mins drive away. Central Mall was good too.",Emma,??.?.-16,5,"London, United Kingdom",Friends,null,null,null,null,null,null

This hotel is very good. Not the cheapest hotel around, but it is worth every bath. Instead of boring you all with my emotional opinion I will try to summarize the qualities that makes us satisfied as tourists.
1. Access - the hotel is located at the top end of beach road. This is family friendly and keep you away from the noisy bars.
2. The hotel is fairly new and appears clean and maintained. It is clean and maintained.
3. The wifi coverage is very good and included in your room. If you need one extra user account it is no problem. No matter where you are in the hotel area you are covered and have a decent connection. 
4. The staff is welcoming and professional. It is enough people at work. 
5. The breakfast is lovely. The food is good and the place is clean. 
6. The in house restaurant, Essence, is very good. They have a decent wine list.
7. The pool area is family friendly, but be aware there are no pool guards. You are responsible for your children safety. There are one smaller pool with a bar inside, this one is super when having a coke with the kids or if you need a beer. There is a lap pool if you want to exercise. There are two bubble baths. 
8. The rooms are nice and housekeeping keeps everything in order. 
9. There are four elevators so your access up and down is easy. 
10. The hotel have a mix of tourists and conference guests. 
11. There are security guards on the grounds.
12. The hotel concierge will help you with your needs. 
Things that can be improved. There is not much to point out, but it seems to me that every hotel I visit has poor tv signals. When in Thailand you don't spend too much time in your room, but tv signals could be better.
Our conclusion is this. When traveling with children this is a hotel that will serve your needs very well. Easy to access, well kept, nice staff and with very good quality.

This has definitely been our home from home resort in Pattaya. We are greeted upon check in like friends rather than paying guests. Each and every member of staff cannot do enough to ensure that your stay is perfect. 

Check in, as expected, swift and efficient. Cold towels and drinks a welcome after the long journey. Free wifi is a bonus and the signal (for up to four appliances) not too bad at all. 

Our room was well appointed, spotlessly clean and looked after twice daily by housekeeping. Sheets were changed daily if required and towels twice daily. Sufficient water provided for tea, coffee and daily use. The housekeeping team  even leave fresh fruit daily for you to enjoy.  

We are fortunate to have club facilities for our stay. What a stunning place to spend some quiet time. The breakfast is superb, beautifully presented and delicious. The evening cocktail hour (actually two hours) is wonderful. Complimentary drinks and food to tempt everybody, all served with the famous Thai smile. The Club Team work tirelessly to ensure that your needs are taken care of. Our grateful thanks must go to May,  Lylaruz, Toom, Mon, Cap, Sophia, Mai, Patoo, Tangmo, Lailah for making our time in the club so enjoyable. 

The management team, especially Richard and Naa, are available to assist at any time. I'm sure that should anyone need assistance on any matter it would be sorted swiftly and efficiently.  

We ate frequently at The Tavern by the Sea. The menu has changed recently, old favourites and some new choices, all thanks to the executive chef Shaun. I don't often eat western food in Thailand, but I sampled the roast rib of beef Sunday lunch!  Delicious, succulent meat, roasted potatoes and a full range of accompaniments; an absolute winner!  The Tavern also offers daily promotions which are great value for money - great food at reasonable prices - a winner in my eyes!

The pool area is lovely for relaxing or taking part in the daily activities; Zumba, yoga or water aerobics. The pool staff are phenomenal, again nothing is too much trouble. Surasak, Pet and Pancha took care of us - thank you guys!

The restaurant downstairs is also surprisingly good. But there are caveats as well to all these great comments:
- as many have said, the hotel is undergoing renovations, so constructions could get in the way. Luckily our room was far so we didn't hear the noise. But navigating around the hotel is slightly tricky.
- my bigger issue is with guests who were blatantly smoking and opening their doors as if they were in their own apartments. We had to complain as the smoke was really unpleasant in the corridor, as well as their noise. The hotel seems to have talked to them, but the smell of cigarettes was still present the next day...

Room: spacious room. Big working desk. Nice shower room. But I don't like the way they design the restroom. I don't know how other people feel, but It's a clear glass wall facing outside. It felt like if a person down below look up and they can just see you.  Personally, a little more privacy would be great. Beside this, everything else were good

Breakfast: Great with a huge varieties to choose. A chef at egg station seemed a little drunk. He didn't cook the egg thoroughly and even drop an egg shell in the omelette, but the other good things outweigh this. 

Pool: Great pool. There are two pools which both are fantastic. Also, there are some activities by the pool like an exercise class or some events, but I was there just one night.

Gym: A little small, but not too bad just enough for you to stick to your workout. The staff was nice. If you read my other review when I stayed in Hilton Pattaya, it was horrible over there.

Parking lot: It will be just one complain here as there are very few parking space. You have to park your car out in sunlight. No garage. No cover. If I have to be there for more than two nights, I might have to reconsider it.

The horizon Club stuff was trying to solve the problem, but they only try to compensate me with a room upgrade (dulex suite) without directly solving the small extra bed issue. As they claimed that they only have one size of extra bed. I didnt take the offer of a free room upgrade, since my original room has an outstanding sea view.

In the end, they only offered to put a small sofa at the end of my extra bed. 

The way the horizon club staff dealing with my complaint made me feel really unpleasant and disappointing, as she treated me like i am making things up just to take advantage from the hotel (eg. free room upgrade or complimentary massage). I dont feel like they were really trying to make my stay more pleasant than it should be. Honestly if they dont have extra bed for adult, you should just let me know in the first place, so that i can book for a larger room or  even 2 rooms.

Beside this matter, the horizon club is excellent, with nice choice of refreshments provide throughout the day. Also Breeze Spa is one of the best facilitate in the hotel, they are very professional, truly relaxing.

I've stayed with them throughout Thailand as well as in Qatar, and Amari Ocean (or Orchid as it is now called) did not disappoint.  

Pattaya can be sleazy.  I personally visited for a family holiday and was super happy with the location of the hotel.  It is on the far side of the beach, away from all of that.  Sure, you can walk to it, but if you stay at the hotel and it's surroundings, you won't really see *much of that stuff.  That being said, if you've come to Pattaya for that stuff, you may want to be more centrally located.  If you prefer going to visit waking street and then returning to a beach oasis, this is a good bet.

The hotel rooms are very modernly designed.  There is a bathtub behind the bed, so you can watch television while taking a soak.  There is also a separate rainfall shower.  There is a balcony too (which I actually used regularly to hang dry my clothes).  There is a lot of storage space.  My main complaint was the bathroom wasn't very private - it could have been better sound proofed if you know what I mean!   House keeping does a turndown service and was very cute: they gave me extra detergent (they saw I was cleaning my clothes), they left me fresh fruit each day since I always finished it.

The hotel has 2 large pools, one with a bar and the other large enough to swim laps.  There are activities for kids and adults (my mum did yoga at 5pm!).  They offer you a complimentary welcome drink and there are 2 for 1 happy hours.  The menu is more expensive then what you will find in town, but it's reasonable. They also have a cheap stall offering soups for 100baht (still more than in town, but not expensive for a hotel).  Wifi was good and you have access to computers and printers at the ice bar (why they merged bar and business Center I have no clue).  We were also welcomed with complimentary foot massage coupons at their spa.

The hotel has a gym, but I wasn't impressed.  It's better than some, but not up to Amari standard in my opinion. The buffet breakfast was large and bring constantly refilled.  I really enjoyed it.

Our room was the Executive club suite ocean view. I cannot recommend this room more highly. From the moment you check in at the executive lounge on the 19th floor till the time they open the huge door into the suite you are in total luxury. The room is enormous and covers the whole end of the hotel with floor to ceiling windows looking out onto the bay of Thailand. These windows allow an almost 180 degree view of the bay. The room was well laid out with a separate kitchen with island bench , dining table , lounge room, desk area and a separate enormous bedroom with ample cupboard space, confortable bed, very large ensuite with a separate WC and a electric privacy screen if needed between the bedroom and ensuite. There are incredible views from the bed. For smokers there are two small balconies one off the kitchen and one off the ensuite. Smoking is not permitted in the room. There is a nightly turn down service and the room was kept nice and clean. The executive lounge was excellent with a varied breakfast, and nice evening cocktails and canapés The staff were excellent especially in the executive lounge and were always smiling and happy to help you in any way. During our stay they were rebuilding some of the hotel and the main foyer and the Amari garden hotel were under construction. This caused no issues and didn’t impact on our stay. Construction work started at 7.00 am on the dot and although it was quite close the noise was barely noticeable. We were also given a basket of fruit and cookies on arrival and a bottle of Perrier water compliments of the house. If you aren’t worried about being on the northern end of the beach this is the hotel  for you.

-there's no outlet in the sink area for hair dryers/curling rods/electric razors. 

Onto the REAL issue
There's really only one reason that I wouldn't stay here, but unfortunately, it's a big enough reason to us that we won't ever go here again unless it changes. There is a 3 foot wide gap between the top of the toilet room ""door"" and the ceiling. There's a 3/4 inch wide gap between the door and the wall. Basically this is like an American public restroom. You can see, hear and smell everything. The bathroom is all tile and windows so IT ECHOES too. So you're in the tub, on the chaise, or in the bed, and guess what? That's the sound of your husband/mom/friend/co-worker/whomever pooping and peeing or even vomiting. Also, the door doesn't latch. This toilet door is ALL aesthetic. I totally understand some people don't care about that at all, but this was so gross to us, we actually used the lobby bathrooms...which had FULL LENGTH DOORS AND NO GAPS. So you need to be 100% comfortable with your travel companion's bowel movements and vice-versa

If you don't mind hearing poop all vacation (and yeah the smell will waft into the main room because, did I mention there's no door?) then this place is otherwise amazing. 

We spent all day at the pool and the service was AMAZING! The kids area was stellar and I would love to spend all week here and never leave the property with my kids
I'm a swimmer and LOVED that I could get laps in at the pool. LOVED!
Mai at the bar was the best server ever and he was SO FRIENDLY 

Really, it's just the toilet thing for us. They don't require any type of verification for the pool, so we even talked about how we'd stay at a nearby hotel with a proper bathroom and just hop over here. Yeah, I hate the sound and smell of fecal matter that much. 
This is a NEW hotel that had a soft opening. THEY DESIGNED IT THIS WAY

The designers literally though:
""Oh people who are married won't mind listening to someone poop"" 
""Oh, if you're comfortable enough sharing a king size bed with someone you won't care if they hear you poop or vomit""
""Oh, but it looks so pretty, who cares""

My previous visit was organised via a travel agent and stayed in the Ocean view tower...but this time I decided to book the hotel directly via their website. As I booked early I had the early bird package which includes breakfast each day...20% on all F&B excluding mini bar, room service and their more upmarket restaurant the ""Mantra""...30% discount on spa treatments too..wifi is also included  (surprisingly quite good). I have stayed many times to Pattaya etch time in different hotels...from Dusit to Holiday Inn....Pullman..so if I decided to stay at the Amari for a 2nd time is that I was impressed with my first visit. My flight arrived on Sunday morning very early and I had booked a limousine service directly with the hotel, but considering that I had booked almost 3 months before I was a bit anxious that no one would turn up, but they did. They did send me a mail to confirm but during my flight which is a bit useless...maybe the hotel should take note to send the mail confirmation for the limousine a couple of days before travel. Check-in was very smooth but as I arrived early i had to wait a bit. I had requested a high floor and was given the 7th floor (#702)  (I think last time I was on the 9th) but happy as very good view over the garden and sea view as I would have expected no less considering that I am spending almost  £1000 just for the room. Rooms are very big..bright...small balcony....mineral water provided each day, that is great...beds are huged and extremely comfortable...housekeeping is very good. I like their pool area...very spacious and plenty of long chairs to choose from  (even the wi-fi works there). Last time I was not really impressed by their pool service when you want to eat or drink something but it seems this time it has improved however I must say that it is relatively quiet...pool waiters are very pleasant once you get someone !! Breakfast at the Essence restaurant is very good...very good service too...catering for all tastes...from European..Asian...veg...etc...Eggs cooked to order...waffles...pancakes. I quite like their Tavern By the sea restaurant if you don't want anything too fancy in a relaxing area. 
However there is something that I am very disappointed about is the "" Happy Hour"" offer when you get another drink free between specific times. I particularly like going into the lobby lounge before dinner and last time I stayed they did the Happy Hour from 6.00pm to 7.30pm and again from 9.00pm to 10.30pm...and on my current visit it was still the same until last night!!!!!when about to sign my bill realised  that they had charged me my drink twice...but was told by the young lady that it had stopped from that day despite the fact that when she offered me another drink she never mentioned it...despite the fact that it was still advertised in the rooms...on TV screens...in the lifts...no not a single warning....but the best is that they decided to change the happy hour to 2.00pm until 4.00pm...absolutely ridiculous...who in this place is going towards benefits from it. I particularly think it's a really bad move to change it without telling their own customers...I call that ""Poor customer communication  ""....nothing less. It really live a bitter taste in my mouth to come back again...not particularly about the happy hour but how it was dealt with. It is little things like that that makes the difference and your stay even more enjoyable.",Enigma,??.?.-16,4,"Brentwood, United Kingdom",Solo,null,null,null,null,null,null

Unfortunately the experience was not that good. The location of the hotel is excellent. I was in the Club Category Room which is the best category below the suite. However, it was not great. The bathroom was very small and the shower cubicle was also very small. The balcony with the room was small and did not provide any great view despite being on the ocean side. The breakfast spread at the hotel was not great. At least, it was below par considering that it is a 5-Star Hotel. The worst part was the service in the restaurant. While having breakfast the staff was not ready to serve you anything except Tea/Coffee. You had to get up every time you wanted something. Even for water, you had to fetch it on your own as they would not serve. It was an extremely ad service. To top it up the worst experience came when I checked out of the Hotel. As soon as I called the reception that I would like to check out, they disconnected the wi-fi within a minute. Worst was yet to come. I was doing the formalities of the check-out and I wanted to have a glass of water. I went to the coffee-shop (ibar) and asked for drinking water. I was told that I have to pay 106 Baht if I wanted water. I told them that I had been staying with them and just checked out and I need a plain glass of water. But the lady there was so rude that she said go and have water in your room or pay 106 Baht. This is ridiculous. I have not seen such a response anywhere in the world. Even in the worst places, people are courteous and even if you are not staying with the hotel, you can get water.

Due to the length of stay we took a family suite with large balcony in the Garden wing but enjoyed the hospitality of Horizons and the Ocean tower.As we had stayed several times previously, we were greeted by the management and staff as long lost relatives, not so lost however!! We re-acquainted our selves very quickly with the staff at the Tavern, a favourite Go to place for casual dinner and drinks into the night with the football, in fact all sports Khun Noi looked after us all very well as did her staff..Sunday of course would not be Sunday without brunch at Mantra. This place is very Special and is not to be missed and Khun Jib looked after us on many occasions.
Drinks and relaxing by the pool with Khun Sac and his team is most enjoyable, especially the reminders for Happy Hour!!
The staff at Essence were equally friendly and and the breakfast buffet as very extensive so no worries about choice.
Khun Gann at Horizons was her professional and delightful self and has wonderful staff, assisting with any detail and providing great service.
Of course no major hotel can operate without an excellent Concierge, and the Amari has just such a person in Khun Preecha. He and his staff can answer any and every question and know all the best places to visit and to eat if you want some good local eateries for a change. He is also a wonder with organising tours, golf, transport etc.
Of course you need good leadership from the top and in Brendan, the GM and Richard, you have this. They are ever present around the property to keep an eye open and to assist whenever necessary.

I am in the travel industry and have stayed at some pretty amazing hotels. The Amari equals the top named hotels. The hotel location in at the beginning of Beach road so a quieter part of Pattaya. You can get bht bussed for 10 bhat per person. be careful though as it is circular and sometimes they will tell you they stop earlier than you want to get off and ask for a lot more money. Just get off and get another bus. It will cost double but the driver will ask for more than this to continue on 1 bus.
I didn't meet one member of staff who wasn't pleasant and helpful. The hotel is very modern and the rooms amazing. We were in a Deluxe sea view on the 17th floor room 1710. The room has a huge bed where I needed to use binoculars to see my husband on the other side lol. Really comfortable. There is a separate bath and walk in shower with a rain shower. The room was kept spotless and if I forgot to fold something the cleaner folded it for me. The only criticism is that the hotel information in the room doesn't have a some important information and although minor doesn't say that if you require ice it can be requested and brought to the room. Saying this it wasn't a problem when asked.
The laundry service is excellent and pressed better than me.
The concierge service is the best I have had. We booked some experiences and before the time to be picked up we were contacted as a reminder. Always with local information and if they didn't know the answer the would find out. When needing a taxi they would ask the driver for the cost so we knew how much we would pay. We did a full day trip leaving before breakfast and the arranged a breakfast box whit was more than expected. So much in it we couldn't eat it all.
there are 2 pools, a relaxing family feel and a free form pool. Maybe because it was the end of the rainy season we had no problem getting loungers with umbrellas (yes it did rain daily but only for a short time and heavy) The pool bar always had a happy hour at 11:30 and we looked forward to a fantastic 2 for 1 smoothie.
Breakfast:
What wonderful staff in all departments from servers, cooks and hosts. They have a great egg station and what ever you wanted they would get for you. I have a cheese allergy and one morning the buffet had potatoes au gratin. I asked it they had potatoes without cheese and the man went off and got potatoes with the sauce without cheese. Plenty of variety including Chinese, Indian and Japanese cuisine (not to my taste but it is there) I must say I have never seen so may people treat these lovely people so badly mostly from India or Russia (I'm not racist) they snapped there finger's and very demanding.  I could see that the lovely staff were very upset as it isn't in their nature not to be helpful. There can be a language barrier but they all do there best to understand. let's face it I don't speak Thai so it is just rude to think they should understand easily.
If anyone is looking for a good Taylor please try the one in the hotel. I had lots of things made and it was great value with fantastic materials.
We stayed for Loy Krathong at the hotel and they put on a wonderful night. 
I thing I have covered everything so please give it a try. This is not an international group hotel like the Hilton but gives you true Thai warmth.",Sue E,?.?.-14,5,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom",Couple,5-Value,5-Rooms,5-Location,5-Cleanliness,5-Service,5-Sleep Quality

Both hotels share grounds, pool etc.  However the Tower is more like a 4 star, and the garden wing a 3 at best. 
We were given room 908, which was a deluxe room- this room was clean, spacious and had good views of the pools and gardens.  The Management of this hotel could not do enough to please the guests in our opinion. 
The pool facilities were superb- clean and the on tap service was great- especially during happy hour. The staff were very attentive, and customer friendly. 
The hotel itself is situated across the road from the beach, with a busy road in front. Handy though, if you need a tuk tuk @ 10thb to take you down the road.  It was my birthday during our stay, and the staff  made me a cake and sang happy birthday- whilst arranging a bouquet of flowers from my partner.  This was a lovely surprise.
The biggest downfall of our stay was the overwhelming number of rude and openly disrespectful/perverted male Indian groups in the hotel. They tried to swim in the pool in their underwear, and would openly sit on the sunbed next to female guests, and stare at their bodies! I was even approached by a said male guest who asked to take pictures of me in my swimwear! The security guards are well aware of the situation- and frequently stood in front of female guests, to ensure the Indian males could not take photographs.  This ruined our trip, and made us not want to sit by the pool. Whilst we understand this to be off season, it is not a good idea to encourage large groups of male guests. This was a common topic of conversation between guests, who like us were not impressed by this harrassing behaviour!  All I can say is that it's a good job that security where present, as i could see many partners/husbands of female guests were becoming increasingly frustrated and were ready to take matters into their own hands! This was extremely disappointing, and un- welcomed, never have I been anywhere on holiday, and felt sexually harassed!

I was aware of the on going construction, and whilst it was noisy from 8 am at the pool it was something I realised I had to put up with.The staff at the hotel ( with one exception) are superb. Extremely friendly and in the main good at their job. They welcome you back as a returning customer with true warmth.
I did notice that breakfast was not as good as it used to be, but it was still good. There have been a few unnecessary cutbacks in my opinion.The pool area was very very quiet throughout my 10 day stay with there mainly being a group of about 8 Brits each day and occasionally t a few guests from other countries.
On my last but one day , I requested as an onyx gold a late check out ( apparently guaranteed upto 4pm). This was initially declined , but I could pay for a 1/2 day and check out at 6pm. I declined and explained as a regular customer and onyx gold I was not happy with their offering.I then booked an airport hotel at bangkok and cancelled my early dinner plans with friends.
Within the hour I was offered a late check out. Apparently thee had been a mix up, as the hotel was very busy.I am not sure where all these guests were but they were never at the pool or breakfast. I found the attitude and performance of the reception staff to be both condescending and unprofessional.On the day I checked out ( at 10.20 am as I thought being so busy they clearly needed the room) I was offered another apology   and promises of a free upgrade on my forthcoming trip.. They totally missed the point , I wasnt after any freebies or compensation. I was merely asking for something they advertise and promise.
I agree with a previous poster The manager only appeared once to help former guests resolve their problem with a local hotel and to move back to the Amari. I also think the odd cold towel and fruit could  be offered once a day as they used to.To sum up great staff. Clean hotel though showing age. poor reception and management.

The room had an ocean facing view. Every day morning (we stayed for 4 days) we were treated to amazing ocean views. Made our day. The room was quite spacious given that my daughter loves to run around and leave her things here and there. Loved the breakfast. Had a good time at the pool. Quite large and safe for kids. The only draw back I noticed at the hotel that it didn't have valet parking. I was driving myself and found this a challenge on nights when we were late to retire.

This was my first time to Thailand and Pattaya.  After a bumpy 1.5 hours drive from Bangkok I was pleased with the relaxing Amari lobby area and a lovely refreshing drink and cold flannel. I was in a standard double room in the Amari Ocean tower with the bathroom integrated with the bedroom apart from a blind between the two. I was impressed by the quality of the room furnishings, power of the shower and storage in drawers and wardrobes. The safe was big enough to hold my large laptop and ipad and still had room for more.
Breakfast had a great selection for all global tastes. It was normally pretty busy by 07:30 although I never had to wait more than 3 minutes for scrambled or fried eggs to be cooked fresh. The staff throughout the hotel were very friendly. The location is also excellent, the hotel is set back from the main road about 300 yards and therefore does not have people walking right past it. On the road is the hotel run Tavern Bar where I had a beer and some fresh cashews nuts and charged it to the room.  As the Amari is at the beginning of the beach road it is a lot quieter than some of the others round the bay. Travel to other restaurants or nightlife was easy by jumping in a baht bus outside the Tavern and going as far as you want for 10THB.
Tip: If you need a few essentials like snacks and water, walk a few a few hundred yards and you will find a mini supermarket downstairs under the teddybear museum by ""Alley 1"".  A little further down the road is Gulliver's which was good for both Western and Asian food.  I had some great Thai food there.",zpme,?.?.-14,4,"Reading, United Kingdom",Business,4-Location,5-Service,5-Sleep Quality,null,null,null

We stayed in the Dusit last February 2017 which was fabulous so we'd seen the Amari and thought it looked nice.
Our ideal hotel is were you can relax around the pool read our books etc and have a couple of drinks and lunch sit there until about 5 ish, could we do any of these things a big NO for the following reasons and backed up by our photos, Construction machinery such as pile drivers drilling into the rock bed in two areas about 5 metres from the partition panelling that had been erected ( Heath and Safety!! ) then further construction they started digging up the car park directly below our balcony of our suite which we paid a lot of money for which would have been well worth the money if there had been no building work being carried out, if this had been a U.K. Based hotel chain they would have been reported to Trading Standards for misleading potential clients and non reporting of work being carried out, on the hotel booking site it clearly states that this work will be finished by December 2018, incorrect a few senior members of staff told us that it will the work will be completed within 2 years I make that December 2019 !!! More incorrect information.
Ah yes almost forgot we booked a late checkout @ £35 which they waived the cost WOW cheers should have been £350 for all the inconvenience and non suitability of gardens and pool area so we spent all ours days down at the beach area and paid for beach chairs for the entire 10 days.
Please take time to look at the photos as this information may save you some future disappointments when booking at this Construction site ups sorry Hotel !!!

When we arrived, we were greeted by the manager and were well taken care of by the staff. We have asked for a room with sea view, which we then got. 
Rooms
The room was very spacious and clean. The balcony was a bit small, but to be hones, we just used it to dry our swim clothes. We have pretty high standards when it comes to hotel rooms and cleanliness, and I must admit, I felt very comfortably at the Amari Ocean. 
Location
We on chose on purpose a hotel at the end of the street, to avoid the bar music etc. There was only once, where we heard some music from the bars, otherwise it was very nicely quiet. It very well located: 10min walk to two big shopping malls, 10min walk to a great fitness center and thaibox center (which was another criteria for us). The beach was 100 meters infront of the hotel, but to be honest, you don't go there for the beach as it is not very appealing.
Staff
Very friendly and staff. After the second day, the staff in the restaurant where you get breakfast was remembering us, and always already prepared the drinks we usually ordered. This was very unexpected and highly appreciated by us.
Negative
There were a few downsides to an very great overall stay. The Amari ocean shares the pool with the Amari garden (which is quite a bit cheaper). This attracts more group travellers. During our stay, we had a large group of Indian man staying at the Amari Garden and then of course occupying the pool. Which is okay, there are 3 pools (two larger, 1 smaller) but what has pissed me off was that they were very loud (yelling at each other) and smoking all the time. This is particularly annoying when you would like to relax and and sleep a bit in the sun.  
What we didn't like about  the hotel were the Cocktail prices and quality. Having been in Koh Samui before, were things are generally more expensive than in Pattaya, we must admit we had some fruit cocktails which cost double of what we paid in Samui and were only half the size. after a while, we simply went to the bar/restaurant at the street which leads to the Amari. They have very nice drinks, reasonably priced and good size.

Every way you go it fun times and great food. Dont pass up the local street venders grilling your next meal for pennies. The temperature averages mid 90 degrees f year round with lots of sun and short lived rain. You can walk for miles to all the attractions or do as the locals and ride a tut-tut. Sort of a truck/taxi that circles the beach road. You wave and they pull over and jump in. When you see your stop you push the buzzer button and pay them 10 baugh. Approximately 35 cents. They will only take you to each end of the road and you have to get off and catch another for the return. In the south you have the temples and the north end you have the infamous walking street thats famed for all sorts of bars, strip clubs, and anything else imagined. In between there are more types of restaurants, bars, spa's, and shops than you can imagine. Its a cultural blender with everyone existing in harmony.

Reading some of the reviews regarding the noise from on going work worries me a bit, but in saying that to upgrade and make it a better hotel then we are prepared to put up with a bit of noise, let’s face it the work has to be done some time so yes there will be some inconvenience. 
We return again on the 9th November 2017 and will be staying as normal for 15 nights. As platinum members all I ask is that management and staff continue to make this a memorable holiday especially as we will be celebrating my husbands birthday. 
We have booked a junior suit ocean view  which we always do, it would be great to be upgraded this time so we do not hear the noise from our room.

Amari Pattaya has there own private beach area which lies just opposite to the property and is just serene to get the best view at any time of the day. Below are some points I would love to highlight on the property-
Interiors- The place is aesthetically pleasing and has interiors which are subtle and classy. Love how the property maintains every section and have planned it so well. A contemporary showcase of traditional Tha noi texture complimented by light tones, simple touches and understated elegant beach house inspired style.
Accommodation at Amari Pattaya are categorized as Amari suites and Amari tower.
Heaven for Good Food FT. Amari Pattaya
The journey to a men’s heart is always through food and trust me those words are true after having some delicious meals at Amari Pattaya. From breakfast to lunch to dinner, trust me guys every meal was heaven for us. The breakfast spread made me wonder what to eat as it had too many cuisines to select from. Being a vegetarian it’s difficult to sustain in south East Asian countries but Amari gave me options beyond my imagination. From Indian traditional breakfast to continental to English.
For the first time ever we tasted Thai food i.e, 5 signature dishes and that too Vegetarian Thai food and its first impression just took my mind away. The Thai food was damn tasty and delicious, love how they made special vegetarian dishes in Thai cuisine and still they tasted like heaven. In-room dining and lunching was amazing. They provided some great indian punjabi food, Italian, Mexican and mind blowing desserts.
Business class Executive Club Lounge
The place as name says depicts class. Lounge that symbolizes utmost professionalism, clean and sharp attitude & look. The lounge is on 19th Floor and is available to those who opt for it during the booking.

Complimentary soft drinks and snacks during the day with a further 2 hour period of hot snacks and international spirits and wines between 1730 and 1930. You can also have your breakfasts in the club if you so desire. Staff in the club are very attentive and remember your preferences when you visit. Difficult to pick any one member of staff out as they are all good and as we were there for 15 nights we had the opportunity of seeing a few of them. My wife made good use of the Breeze spa and visited it on several occasions. All the staff were very friendly and the treatments were all explained when she arrived. On the expensive side by Thai standards but well worth the extra cost. All the staff throughout the hotel were welcoming, friendly and a great credit to Brendan the general manager. We spoke to him on several occasions in different areas of the hotel and he was always welcoming. On a lighter note he was good company on the night of the Scotland / Australia rugby match. We both agreed it was a close run thing?

We were in Pattaya celebrating our 5yr Wedding Anniversary, and the hotel had very nicely taken that into consideration and decorated our room very nicely on arrival. Very memorable for us!
The room was just wonderful with beautiful decoration and a view to die for. Housekeeping was done very well during our whole stay (twice a day) and roomservice was prompt and food very good, both thai and western dishes. 
The Club services (Club lounge on 19th floor with breakfast and evening cocktails & snacks and coffee/softdrink sevice all day) were good quality and staff very friendly helping with table reservations and such needs. 
The only minor problem was when our key card stopped working at one point, but it was fixed in an instant so it kind of stayed in mind because of how quickly it was solved. :)
The pool area and garden are large and staff there very friendly and efficient. The quality of sunbeds is very good and during our stay it wasn't too crowded at any point. My personal pool side lunch favourite was the noodle soup served from a cart every day between noon and 3pm (if rain did not bother). Had to have it every day! :D

We used the Tavern bar a couple of times and the buffet was fantastic value for money.
The hotel is located at the north end of beach road with a few quiet bars and restaurants close by. If you want to go down to walking street then the baht buses stop just outside the hotel to take you there.
All in all a great time there. A good indication of this was the fact that we would both happily return to the same hotel.

I cant believe that we got the package for about 10,000 baht (approx £190). 
We were certainly not disappointed and we had a view of the bay to die for with huge windows stretching across the room. The bath and twin sinks were open plan with the sitting area and bed with separate enclosed toilet and shower rooms. We had all the trimmings expected of a room of this nature with toiletries, slippers (sadly pre-worn), dressing gowns, tea & coffee making facilities, complimentary water, DVD player etc.
Checking in was in the club lounge with welcome drinks although non-alcoholic drinks and snacks are available free all day. Between 1730 and 1930 hours the club lounge provides free alcoholic drinks and hot and cold snacks. The food was more than ample and extremely tasty - we didn't need to go out for dinner thus making a saving on both nights. 
The spa & massage were excellent although the hairdresser was unavailable as he/she was on holiday! The pool  was fine although nothing out of the ordinary or particularly well presented. 
I would certainly recommend this hotel and in particular the club rooms - go on the hotel website and look at their packages.

Love the renovations and pool areas which is a vast improvement from previously. Would like to especially thank Pear for your assistance in helping us upgrade to a Executive Club room. All our previous stays have been in club rooms and would highly recommend. Love the look of the Club lounge and makes it more spacious. Thank you to Apple and all the lovely ladies in the lounge area for there special treatment and you are all such a huge asset to the hotel. Many thanks to the breakfast, cleaning and pool staff for your very friendly interaction. We understand that the hotel is focusing on a more family environment and that is good as I feel Pattaya is becoming more known for this rather than the sleaze of many years ago. Makes it more interesting to visit every year. But I am going to refer to a comment from Vicvladb from a review on 3/11 also from Melbourne. Please do not forget about your repeat customers that have enjoyed coming back year on year. As a couple we have enjoyed the atmosphere, staff and location of this hotel. But on the weekends the kids area/main pool gets over run from ex-pat families etc coming down for the wkend. You get the kids jumping from there area into the big pool and you cannot move for inflatable toys and kids screaming. This is where you need to improve with an adults ONLY area. The front lawn is being highly un utilised to its full potential, I am not interested in a sitting space, look at what The Holiday Inn next door has. The new restaurant will be fantastic and I am sure that will work for the hotel. But you need an Adults only beach club(like they have in Bali and Fiji) with cabanas and pool. You will lose people like us - couples that stay for 9-10 days every year and enjoy there quiet spaces and not having to put noise canceling headphones on. This was your high season, but also very quiet. I would hate to think what it would be like during very busy periods. We would consider staying elsewhere on our next visit if tourism has picked up as we like to have that balance of kids space and adult areas.

Many things was worn down. Our room doorbell was stabbed(?!) broken. There was rusty circles on sink area. And black stains on the floor. Not poor cleaning obviously but things are just getting old. Some of the roofs of the cabanas by the pool were broken. Some of them had holes and some were leaking in the rain.
Cigarette smoke came somewhere to our room even our room was supposed to be non smoking. That wasn't nice.
You should defenitely fix this kind of things to make this a five star hotel again.
Other problem was certain nationalities travelling in big groups. 
There was way too little staff for them. In breakfast you had to guard your table because these groups didn't wait to be seated - they just sit where ever they liked - and sometimes tried to take your table while you were taking food. 
They also weren't asked their room number because they didn't wait to be seated. They just rushed in. Hard to say have they even paid for the breakfast.
The staff is way too kind and nice to stop their rushing.
We also saw one guest from these groups tasting chili sauce from the bowl and then putting the spoon back to the bowl! And other time those guests touching food with their hands and putting the food back! That was not hygienic at all! You should have more staff watching the food to avoid this kind of acts.
Also these big groups arrive the same time to the breakfast room and it can become very crowded. We understand that they bring money to the hotel but you should do something about these issues because in the other hand they scare away other guests.
Staff and service was still very good. 
The lobby was crowded with groups when we arrived and the staff lead us to wait in the lobby bar with welcome drinks. Finally checked us in the lobby bar so we didn't have to wait in lines. Very good service!
Pool area is one of the best in Central Pattaya - or maybe even the best. Two big pools.

It was formerly one of our 'go to' hotels for its genuine hospitality. After its extensive renovations we were pleased with: the opening of the pool area to the beach; the general quality of the refurbishments;  and, we loved our Executive Club Suite Ocean View room. We noted that the quality and range of food in both Amaya/Essence and the Executive Lounge has markedly declined. The Pool service is no longer welcoming, only responding to our requests after we walked up to the eatery. Generally, that is the nature of the service: it is competent/professional but neither engaging nor friendly. We really miss the Mantra: such excellent food and an elegant venue. The pool lounges have limited adjustment: great to recline not sit.
Similarly to other reviewers we have also concluded that Amari has shifted its focus upon families with young children. What is disappointing for us is that to achieve this they have cut away all the spaces for couples and single travellers to have a quiet space in and by a pool. We do enjoy seeing little children splashing about with their caring parents but, having demanding jobs, we also need space for tranquillity. I hope Amari decides to accommodate both types of guest groups again, especially as the hotel's greatest number of rooms is dedicated to one or two guests.",vicvladb,?.?.-19,3,"Melbourne, Australia",Couple,null,null,null,null,null,null

Unfortunately this visit was negatively affected by the construction and renovation taking place and we would hesitate to go back until it is completed. 
PROS
- The staff at the Amari were incredibly friendly. From the people greeting us in the lobby to even the housekeeper (special call out to the friendly older woman on the 8th floor) we were greeted warmly wherever we went. 
- New lobby is clean and spacious
- Rooms are spacious and modern
- Very nice view of Pattaya Bay from rooms facing South
- Hotel is very close to the beach
- Mantra next door is one of the best restaurants in Pattaya
- Website was easy to use for booking
CONS
- Renovation taking place on several floors- noise and strong smells
- Construction taking place outside with some noise and a view of construction from rooms facing North
- Spa is currently closed
- Pool was closed due to a temporary issue of contaminated water, it's also surrounded by barriers
- Car parking is limited and outdoors only
- Kids club has been relocated to a meeting room
- Although our first room seemed to have been newly-renovated the garbage can was rusty, blinds had stains, and our coffee pot had mold growing in the bottom of it. Seems some room 
Our room on the 16th floor had a smell of new carpet and wood when we arrived but we thought it would be tolerable. The next day when we came back to the room after lunch there was a very powerful paint smell coming in through the aircon. We called the service number who said a technician would come up and take a look. A while later a housekeeper arrived with a scented room spray which wasn't coming close to masking the very strong smell. She went away for a while and we didn't hear an update. 
We were traveling with a baby so I finally went to the lobby to ask for help. They agreed to move us to another room on a lower floor which faced the construction. No bad smells so I took the offer. It was our baby's nap time so I asked if we could wait a few hours to pack and move our stuff and we were told no, that the hotel was fully booked so they needed to use the room ASAP. I warned them that any guests moving in would not be happy with such an overpowering smell of paint. 
Although we had to move to a lower floor and lost our view of the bay in exchange for a construction view there wasn't an offer of compensation, which was disappointing given we had booked a Grand Deluxe Ocean View room. 
Had it not been for the super friendly approach of the hotel staff I would have rated this a two-star visit. As most of the problems stem from renovation it seems once everything is finished that the hotel will be a great property again.

Rooms: we were lucky to receive an upgrade to a 2 story room up on the 20th (last) floor, so we were very (!) happy with the room. Spacious, clean, really good. 
Pool: great great great, also has a bar in the middle of the pool with happy hour daily 15:00 - 17:00. Plenty of fresh towels and space for all to sit and relax. 
Mosquitos: 6 nights and not even one!
Location: there are better locations... Amari is at the northern end of the beach strip (at the ""beginning""). But transportation is easy with local pickup taxi's that go in circles and it is only 10 baht per person. 
For other attractions hotel has great taxi service with fair prices, clean cars, very nice English speaking drivers that will happily wait for for no additional charge. 
Beach: this is probably true for the entire strip, not just Amari. This beach is more of a water sport beach and less for swimming. 

Food: Breakfast buffet has basically everything - you won't stay hungry. 
Restaurant, one very good thing is that the hotel provides fair prices on entire menu. 

Hotel: one big minus is that behind the pool there is a huge construction site where they are building more parts of Amari (due Dec 2018), no security worries but at time it can be noisy. 

Kids play area: due to the above renovation the current kids are is a little table next to the pool was very nice and staff, mostly arts and crafts. 

Price: we booked via Amari website and used the no refund deal, so I can definitely say I got my money's worth and more.

However, the construction was really loud by the swimming pool.  I was expecting to have a relaxing weekend doing nothing by the swimming pool (probably falling asleep on the chair), but it was not relaxing with all the noise.  I believe the hotel rate reflected the fact that the construction was going on, but I did not realize how loud all the noise from drilling, hammering, etc. could be.  They are not building anything as of October 15, they were working on the groundwork, so you will hear a lot of drilling and hammering noise.

The hotel nicely upgraded us to the duplex suite with lounge access to remedy. The room was set up with a birthday cake and a bottle sparkling wine. That was really impressed. We did enjoy the room and lounge moment.

But, we had found out that there was no robe in the closet and we did call the front office to get them as we planned to go to pool early morning before the kids. We waited about an hour with 2 follow up calls and nothing happened till we got them in the morning at 6.50 am.

The pool in the morning was peaceful and well maintained. The breakfast moment was really messy and busy without any staff assigned the seats and no social distancing was practiced at all.

The pool area is now described, quite justifiably, as an Aqua Park with good reason: whilst clearly designed with kids in mind, with paddling pool and various water slides to suit all ages, there is plenty of pool space for adults too. 

Located at the northern end of Beach Road the ‘resort’ is located in a secluded part of town and is positioned just 100 metres from the beach. Opening shortly (in 4 week’s time) is the final stage of the redevelopment, the Beach Café, located on Beach Road and which has views right across the beach.

I have previously stayed in several Amari hotels, their staff are almost entirely local, and you are greeted with a radiant smile. The place is impeccably run and nothing is too much trouble. Amari Pattaya is very much a family friendly place yet, should the bright lights of Walking Street beckon, they are a just 30 minute walk away.

This is a very large hotel, and the newer of the two Amari properties that are side-by-side.  Surprisingly this hotel feels nicely secluded from the chaotic environment that surrounds it.  The hotel appears relatively new, and looks to have about 20 floors.  The outside area is nicely landscaped and the pool area is very large with lots of trees and landscaping.  The lobby area is somewhat small with a seating area that is comfortable but designed just as a place to wait while checking in or waiting for someone.  Adjacent to the lobby is a lovely lounge area with comfortable relaxed seating and floor to ceiling windows with a view of the outdoor landscaping.

The third floor is the breakfast dining area that was functional but not particularly noteworthy. The breakfast was a pretty typical buffet style with an extensive selection of western and Asian items, full custom egg prep station, and nice selection of smoked salmon, cheeses, cold meats, salad and fruit station.  They also offered fresh squeezed juice station that featured one type of drink each day (e.g. watermelon, pineapple, etc.).  The pool was also accessed via the 3rd floor (but the pool area is entirely on the ground).

We booked a “junior suite” which was a large single room with a king bed, a desk/chair, and two easy chairs and table.  Typically a suite has a separate sitting area with sofa and chairs, but this setup did not, however the room was spacious and we had an end unit that afforded us windows on two sides of the room.  The décor was contemporary and bright.  The bed was comfortable; the pillows were not terribly comfortable so I suggest ordering up additional pillows if you need them.  The bathroom sinks and soaking tub were open to the bedroom located behind the headboard/nightstands.  Separating the bedroom and bathroom was a long set of wooden blinds that you could lower to give you a bit of privacy in that area.  The shower room was enclosed to the left, and featured both a rain-style shower head and hand shower.  The toilet room was somewhat enclosed and to the right of the sinks.  However, and this is a huge issue in my opinion, the door to the toilet room was not a floor to ceiling door.  There was a gap of about 2 feet at the top, so not private at all and anyone using the toilet would be availing anyone else in the room to any associated noise from the person in the toilet room – if you catch my drift!  Quite embarrassing if you prefer to keep that part of your daily life top yourself.  The double sinks were nice and very well lit; and there were plenty of amenities provided.

There was a tiny balcony with a couple of chairs but it was not large enough to enjoy sitting out there.

The closet and drawer storage space was ample and there was a coffee & tea service setup and stocked (but chargeable) small refrigerator.

The value was exceptional, three nights for USD 295.00.  I suspect this was due to the fact that there was a pretty low occupancy rate not just at this hotel but also across Pattaya.  It seems the tourist count is way down and our observation of the streets would confirm that.  My sense too is that this hotel caters to large tour groups and we happened to see one such group during our stay.  If the hotel were full, the pool areas would become quite busy I would think.

Rooms in the ocean wing were spacious, well appointed and offered all modern amenities. Good view of the garden area, 2 large pools and the ocean. 

Situated on the main beach road, the pattaya beach was a minute's walk across the road which we frequented during the stay.

Hotel provides many activities like yoga, pool exercises for those interested. Breakfast buffet was quite good with many choices over our stay.

Location also gets tops mark as the property is at the north end of beach road and away from the hustle of south end. But still a short ride away on a baht bus.

We ate at their tavern by the sea restaurant on few occasions. Located right on the beach road, it is a good place to eat, watch sunset and just unwind after a long day of activities. Good menu choices, different theme nights every day and reasonable prices.

Just one thing I took issue with at amari as I find that available in other hotels. Their club facilities are not on offer for children. That prevented us from taking a higher category room. If amari positions itself as family resort then it should reconsider it's stance on club access.

Easy hassle free check in. Good sized rooms but the balcony is quite small. All amenities supplied in the rooms and good quality ones too. Very good comfortable beds with extra pillows supplied.

My son absolutely loved the pool and water slide. Quite large compared to other resorts in Pattaya. We spent quite a lot of time in it. Pool towels are provided and no annoying cards to hand in/pick up when towels are brought back like many other resorts.

The breakfast buffet was really good with a large selections of food and an egg station to cook up what ever you request. I had to stop myself eating too much at breakfast time, lol. I did unfortunately find the room service food to be not up to the quality it should be for such a resort and, in my opinion, quite over priced. I have stayed in many of the 5 and 4 star resorts in Pattaya over the years and even the more expensive 5 star resorts have cheaper room service prices and better quality food. It's the only real thing I found disappointing at Amari. 

The location is great for families as it it is at the north end of Pattaya beach so away from all the 'other' stuff in Pattaya. Very easy to get around as it is right on the baht bus routes (at 10 baht per person) so no need to spend a lot on transportation getting around Pattaya. Not a,lot of stuff out the front on beach road near the resort but if you walk around to the back through the lane way next to the main entrance there plenty of restaurants and shopping available .The new Terminal 21 and Central Marina are within easy walking distance.

All round, a very good resort that I will definitely recommend and come back to again next time we are in Pattaya.

The hotel is located on the beachfront in a nice quiet area (North Pattaya). Perfect place for families with children. Not only this area allows you to enjoy the beach vibe with plenty of restaurants and bars along the street, but it also keeps you away from wild nightlife and hassles. 
Hotel staffs were always smiling and greeting. They all were well-trained to make the best experience for the guests. Special recognition to Khun Pear and the Halloween team on Halloween night. 
Front desk staff who checked us in was friendly and helpful. Check-in process was efficient. Unique refreshing welcome drinks. Kids' Check-in was fun for a role play with little reward. Great idea for kids!
Deluxe room was modern and nice decor, yet functional, spacious, neat and tidy. Our room was half facing the pool and the sea. We got the cool breeze from the balcony. Bed and pillows were comfortable. We had a good sleep every nights. The bathroom was very well-designed, spacious and clean. They provided both rain shower and handheld shower in the shower box as well as a lovely bath tub. The toilet with the door was separate inside the bathroom. The good quality of amenities were provided with the refill on each day. 
The swimming pools were impressive. It was relaxing on the pool chair but could be very uncomfortable without the shade in a sunny day. The mini water park was fascinating. Pool staffs were attentive and helpful. Pool bar's food and drinks were nice. Lychee Mojito was exceptional. 
Kids's Club and outdoor playground with the scheduled activities were awesome. We hoped to meet the mascots Rose and Sky next time. 
Overall experience was phenomenal. It's nearly flawless in all aspects. However, we would like to provide some constructive feedbacks for your improvements:-
(1). English language option for Kids Shows on TV Channels (Nikeledeon, Disney Junior and Boomerang) should be provided for foreign kids. 
(2). The afternoon ""Happy Hours"" service at the pool bar should be provided like the Amari Hua-Hin. 
(3). Some days the housekeepers was very delayed to clean our room (they arrived at 4pm.) regardless of the sign ""please make up room"" we placed at 9am. 
(4). Noises of the multiple door slams on our floor were disturbing especially in early morning or late night. Having the doors that automatically close softly and quietly to prevent a slam would be good. 
(5). As the pool area was massive and pool chairs/beds were all over the place---some was isolated and there was no staff nearby. The hotel should provide an easy access for the guests to order snacks and drinks without having to walk back and forth from their pool chairs/beds. 
Thank you for your gracious hospitality and make our stay memorable. We will definitely return to your hotel again.

The hotel do warn of ‘Renovations’ when you book. Strictly speaking the Ocean wing is being renovated and sometimes it can be noisy during the day, never a problem at night.
What they don’t mention is most of the grounds are taken over by a new major construction. They are building a new high rise wing and a second Hotel just a few metres away from the swimming pool. It’s very noisy during the day. I would suggest this will be ongoing for the next year or more. Consequently the swimming pool area  is very noisy and not quite as clean and dust free as it should be.
If you want a quiet break this is probably not the best hotel to choose. Be aware though Pattaya is like one big building site at the moment.
Only real problem we experienced was particular tour groups that ‘Grace’ this hotel. They arrive in large groups from a country not too far away. They are very disruptive in the corridors around their bedrooms. They leave doors open and shout and congregate there without any respect for other guests. Late at night we had problems when they return drunk making a nuisance of themselves. At the breakfast buffet they wander around selecting food with their fingers and eating off plates as they walk. Consequently they touch other display food with saliva coated fingers - totally unhygienic. We did bring this to the attention of hotel staff who were already trying hard to educate them to use the thongs  provided. I have suggested they are given separate dining facilities so as not to contaminate other guests food.",Mark K,?.?.-18,3,"Kamala, Thailand",Couple,null,null,null,null,null,null

The resort is located at the start of North beach and was pretty easy to locate coming from Bangkok. 
Our room on the 15th floor had a massive glass vista opening out to the North Pattaya Bay. The view is breathtaking from out there with a healthy sprinkling of liners and yachts.
For the day of our anniversary, we were upgraded to an executive suite in the exclusive 19th floor, with its own seating and dining areas along with a functional kitchen.
We spent the evening enjoying a 7-course fine Asian menu paired with wines at the Mantra restaurant at the southern end of the property. 
If you crave for Indian food in Pattaya, Mantra has an exclusive Indian section with authentic Indian specialties tastefully crafted by Chef Sridhar.
The breakfast buffet was sumptuous with a healthy mix of Thai, Continental and yes, Indian delectables along with sinfully tempting croissants, cakes, and pastries. you even have an option to enjoy your breakfast by the pool.
If you are a couple or are going with the family to Pattaya, you need to stay at Amari for a taste of exclusive Thai hospitality! 
Note: Yes, the property is under renovation as they are adding around 100 rooms. However, we were never disturbed by construction noise in the upper floors or sea facing rooms.",Sid B,?.?.-17,5,"Bengaluru, India",Couple,5-Location,5-Cleanliness,5-Service,null,null,null

The beach is right across the street with plenty of seating. Everything is within walking distance. Plenty of shops, malls , restaurants all around.
Had a really relaxing massage at the Breeze spa. Overall, everything was very nice. Everyone was very friendly. Always had smiles on their faces. Breakfast spread was great too with plenty of options for everyone.

The breakfast in the main dining room is what will bring me back to this hotel.  There were so many choices for Western  and Asian guests that it was more of a case to have to decide what not to eat rather than in some hotels looking for something you like.  The standard and quality of the food was really very good and fresh and tasted great 
I did not take breakfast in club lounge but enjoyed the high quality service and food at 5.30 pm to 7.30 pm every day.  As other guests have mentioned the offerings outside of this 2 hour service is so limited. You would be forgiven for thinking you are just sitting in a reception area rather than a club lounge.  This is a poor management decision nothing to do with the highly professional staff working in there.  People want all day options and are willing to pay that on a room price so either provide a full club lounge service,  charge for it or don't have one at all 
The pools are great with nice drinks especially at 2 for 1 on happy hour plenty of comfortable loungers 
Was disappointed that the beach immediately across from the hotel is closed off and under refurbishment but no expected date of completion and little sign of anyone working there.  This deterred me from my morning beach walk because I didn't want to walk too far down the road to access the beach so I just cba 
The rooms are clean with comfortable bed a small balcony and good rain shower.  Nice bath too if it's your thing   Club lounge access could give complimentary non alcoholic drinks in the mini bar but not at this hotel   It is so dated to see products so ridiculously priced that it's pointless putting them there when a family mart visit always provides me what I need to hold in the fridge for a few days  
I would return here for the breakfasts alone but I recommend a review is carried out on the club lounge because the reduction in service is really disappointing and lowers the service quality and expectations from club lounge guests with what is a good underused facility with highly professional staff 
Btw you can park in the gardens car park and easily walk through the reception and grounds of that part of the hotel past the pools and to level 3 of the tower to access your room if the parking is limited at the tower carpark 
The newly opened marina shopping center is not far from Amari and when terminal 21 is completed ( at least a year though ) this will further enhance the position of Amari north shore.

Crazy scruffy place and not my cup of tea.  Old man's paradise.  Anyway, on with the hotel review.
Rooms and service excellent.  Breakfast excellent, food around the pool not amazing but ok.
The Tavern by the Sea at the front of the hotel is a little expensive and has a 10% service charge plus the tax but it is worth it for the sea view and sunset around 6pm.  Also the Mantra restaurant next door is superb and upmarket, food excellent and couldn't be faulted.
So glad we chose here, we were upgraded to the Ocean View through a double booking.  We did see both sides and they are completely different.  Amari Garden is a bit dated but you can use both sides and facilities so we would have still been happy with our choice.  The room also had built in sockets for UK plugs which was great as we didn't have an adaptor.
I would have given it 5 star but there were people around the pool who were from other hotels which affected us wanting to take the prime bed locations and brollies.  There were enough beds don't get me wrong - but - old men wanting to nurse their hangovers around the pool that we are paying for was not on.  I hope the management take this on board and do something about it.  I didn't feel it was my place to get them into trouble especially while we were there so please don't say 'why didn't you tell us?'   We are on our holiday to relax and I wasn't going to cause any fuss.  Service around the pool is not amazing either although the guys were very nice and did remind people of happy hour which is at 11.30 and is 2 drinks for price of one.  Also a bit later on in the afternoon too.

When I arrived, it was 2pm and my rooms were not ready; they were being cleaned at the time. 
So, they sat me in a waiting room and offered some good cold tea.  However, I went to get more tea next day and they charged me 3 dollars. 
When my rooms were ready, I went to take a shower. My room has a separate bathtub and shower. The bathtub needs to be cleaned more throughly. Also, on my second day, I realized that the lady did the cleaning but did not scrub the bathtub. 
Breakfast was really delicious. It is a buffet with all kinds of international and local food. It is included in the price of the room. You can see the pics attached.",Salua K,?.?.-16,4,"State College, Pennsylvania",Family,null,null,null,null,null,null

My partner and I, arrived the hotel around 2PM and found that it was so busy during the long weekend (26-28FEB2021). We were waiting around 10 minutes for the checked in line and we were waiting for the room ready at the Executive Club lounge on 19th floor. We had enjoyed having a coffee and juice with a stunning view of the red umbrellas by the pool and the view from the sea.
For the room, it is huge, provide with convenient facilities and fitted with a sexy bathtub behind the bed. Love the toilet room which is separate from the shower room and we could enjoy its with view. Shower room is big and overhead rain shower is great with the water power. Hot and Cold shower is working well.
The Executive Club Lounge was too busy during the free flow drink in the evening, there were too many kids and families. However on the 2nd day, it more pleasure with a less number of the guests in the lounge.
The next day, we found that Executive Club Lounge was still busy during breakfast time (9AM), then we went to Amaya Food Gallery instead. We were enjoy having breakfast outside by the pool. Breakfast lines were busy as well even the hotel provided both indoor and outdoor. There are many choices of the food, Thai, Japanese, Chinese, and International food as well. Staffs were very nice, greeting us keep smiling even the situation was too busy and crowded for the breakfast.
During the day, we spent a short break by the pool and love the sib by the pool.
Such a  pity that the bar closed too early 7pm. Then we order the room service and just chill and enjoy the view in the room.

The last time we were here 2 years ago they were in the middle of a major refurbishment with the garden wing being demolished. This time the renovation is complete. Rooms in the tower block have been refurbished. As usual we stayed in the executive floor and used the lounge extensively. Room has been updated and really nice. Check in was easy and efficient. We used the hotel transportation from the airport and that is well worth the money. We tended to have breakfast in the executive club as it was nice and quiet for us. We also had tea and snacks during the day there. They put a nice selection of snacks in the evening between 1730 and 1930. The pool was nice and seemed popular. My wife used the breeze spa for some treatments and thought it was really good. She especially liked the treatments from ""Gift"" and always felt really relaxed after them. The concierge ""Woody"" was also with organising taxis and helped deal with an issue with one of them. I would like to thank him for his assistance with that. Management were well represented by Jane and Thanida who were always on the go and asking how our stay was. The only slight niggle with our stay was with housekeeping. The girls did a really good job with the room but it seemed that the rooms weren't getting done until around 1800? A couple of times we caught them during the day and when asked they came and did the room. It may be a management issue with scheduling? We spoke to Jane about it and she said she was aware of the issue and would bring it up at the next management meeting. It was the only niggle during our 11 night stay here.

We visited this hotel last week of december, it was an experience in itself. We had booked ocean view room and were upgraded to junior suite room. The room was very beautiful. It had very beautiful view of ocean and pattaya skyline. We were given room no 600. It was very well made. The property is very big, nice swimming pool. Breakfast is good, with few indian dishes. In our package we had one dinner at Mantra. Ambiance of restaurant is good but few indian options. 
The location is at the start of beach road but local baht bus at 10 bahts is very good option. It is conveniently located close to Alcazar, art in paradise and far from maddening crowd at walking street.  We also liked pattaya, it is very different city catering to all types of tastes. 
Small hitch was about deposit they ask at the time of check in. They accpept payment when you leave but insist for deposit. We had little problem of credit card charging because of this but resolved quickly once i approached. It took little time to do this that is why i have given 4 stars and held one back.

First of all , the hotel is at the end of beach road but set back from the road unlike others along the beach front. This means that you can relax by the pools in landscaped grounds without the noise and bustle of the busy main road . Also, you are not reliant on shuttle buses or baht buses from the hotels on the outskirts of the main hub of the city because a short 1 min.walk down the  drive and you are on one of the main streets in the centre of pattaya.
It's a 15 min walk along the beach road to the infamous Walking Street but you can just jump on a passing baht bus if you prefer. There are plenty of market stalls to explore as well as modern shopping centres and Pattaya Night market is on the road behind.
If you are booking trips then I highly recommend you book them through hotels2thailand.com.  They can do them for half the price you would get charged if you were doing it independently...And they include hotel pickups and drop offs...We did the elephant sanctuary and Alcazar and Tiffany shows through them. The hotel has computers and printers and printing off confirmation is no problem and the staff will help in this if you need them to.
We travelled to sanctuary of truth and big Buddah independently by negotiating with baht bus drivers (very cheap). However The Sanctuary of Truth is well off the beaten track so getting back to the hotel was frustrating in the sense that baht buses were not allowed to take you out but were obliged to direct you to the sanctuary's own taxi service which of course was much more expensive but it was the only option. (Should have booked through hotels 2thailand...Would have been cheaper!!). We also went to big Buddah by baht bus but entry is free and it's just up from a main road so we were able to walk down hill 2 mins and get another baht bus back to hotel.
We were in a club executive ocean view room (1818) which was simply marvellous. It also came with the added bonus of having access to the club lounge where from 5:30 to 6:30pm you could enjoy unlimited food of the highest quality and any drinks or cocktails for no extra charge. The staff up here are exceptional....So polite, so welcoming and all do their job with a smile and nothing is too much trouble. Amazing staff!! (I have to mention one particular guest who thought it was acceptable to walk around in the lounge and food area with bare feet....Rather off-putting for the rest of us and we did feel that his ignorance and arrogance should have been challenged).
Breakfast has a great array of choices but unfortunately we found the hot dishes were often only just warm and on occasion cold.

It is really a wonderful place a great night life , really lively .great place to enjoy , safe , reasonable , good properties hotels are really nice , good indian food joints .make sure u get a good hotel as there are small hotels for all mischievous things but with family u must stay in 4 star or 5 star properties preferably. 
We stayed at Amari Ocean view , the property is good but front office staff is pathetic , no courtesy .we indians are more courtesy extending to guest , At check in they asked us to deposit all money in adance plus security deposit. Perhaps not the five star treatment I expected from Amari group , the front office staff are bringing down the image of the hotel .our checkin was awful. My hamily holiday start was bad even though it is one of the costliest properties.  To move around in Pataya best to take a share tuk tuk which like open jeep by paying 10 bhatt.

Hotel is situated to the north of the city away from all the seedy areas. However, to walk out to second road where shops and restaurants are is a bit of a trek. Have to come out of hotel and walk upside holiday inn to get to second road. Doing this several times is annoying. Why not make a gateway at the side which allows easier access and less walking.

first problem, car parking, before you could park outside or very close, now the purpose built car park is about 10 mins walk away from the entrance...yes there is a buggy service but out of six visits i manged to catch a buggy twice.
the biggest disappointment was the dining....before in the Mantra they had the best dining in Pattaya, so in anticipation i went to the dining room lunchtime to book a table for 7 that night...no problem. On arrival at 7 place closed..and informed the only dining option was the poolside bar. So over to the pool, firstly, tables had no lights, so out with mobiles to read menu, which was extremely limited in options, ordered the waited nearly 1 hour to be served, two thai dishes sea bass and a burger and chips, we were the only guests.
after the meal we settled down for drinks, only to be told that at 9.30 they were closing!
the only saving grace is the the ladies on the 19 floor are first class in the level of service  they provide
the one observation i would make is that the hotel is catering more to the Asian guests, over 80 of guests seen were Chinese Koren Japanese and not so the Europeans.
so if you drive  car and like fine dining you shoiuld try the Avani in Pattaya.",fergume,?.?.-20,1,"Bangkok, Thailand",null,1-Value,4-Rooms,1-Service,null,null,null

Nice to have different areas so you can minimize the screaming child running pool side if you go on a couple's vacation.

It’s so easy to get to from Bangkok, and so much better than the endless hours it takes to get to mediocre Hua Hin. On a good day, the journey can be down in under 90 minutes. We love this hotel because it’s modern, refurbished with a great breakfast and a fantastic pool area for the kids to play in. 
We always take a sea view room which provides an incredible panoramic view of Pattaya, stretching as far as the eye can see. The bed is so comfortable and they can provide an extra bed for your kids. The rooms are refurbed and very clean and modern.
We were lucky enough to have access to the executive lounge on this occasion, which is beautiful and very well looked after. The breakfast provides a fantastic spread with eggs made fresh to order. The pastries are exquisite, as is the fresh bread. Service is charming and relaxed. 
At night time the lounge provides canapés and cocktails. Most hotel exec lounges provide mediocre evening offers, but the Amari provides a wonderful spread. The chef will whip up a fresh som tam salad for you, or you can choose chicken bites, cheeses, cold meats, fruits, fresh bread, crackers and olives and pickles. The drinks served are top quality, with a cocktail of the day always included, as well as Prosecco, which was perfectly chilled. The staff are very generous with top-ups too.
But of course it’s the staff who make a hotel outstanding and we are grateful to Jane who always remembers us and is immensely charming and a true hospitality professional.  Also thanks to Jo and his team who looked after us throughout. 
We had one lunch at the hotel and the prices are really good. An omelette with rice, a burger and a couple of cokes came in at around THB800, which is great pricing for a 5 star hotel.
The pool area outside is huge and absolutely stunning. Over the years, my son has progressed from the small kiddie slides to the big toboggan slide, which keeps him well entertained. There’s a bigger free form pool for those a bit more serious about swimming.
The hotels located well away from the sleazy parts of Pattaya and the beach directly in front of the hotel is stunning.

We booked 3 rooms - 4 months in advance. We clearly noted we needed 2 adjoining rooms and the 3rd room all on the same floor. We explained we are 2 families travelling with special needs kids, and needed to be together. 1 month prior, I emailed the hotel again reminding them of the importance of our request. I replied that this has been clearly noted. When we arrived we were advised no only were our rooms not adjoining, they were on different floors. We told them, this was not suitable. They offered us 3 rooms on the same floor, but 1 with single beds instead of King beds. We accepted this as the rooms we booked also included sofa beds, so we could be flexible. When we went up to our rooms, they didn’t have sofa beds as promised. They said there was nothing they could do, but we could rent rollaways at 750baht per night. After much arguing that we had paid for rooms that included king beds and a sofa bed, if they couldn’t supply the sofa bed we shouldn’t have to pay for a rollaway, we were given 1 rollaway free of charge. 
We also paid for 1 breakfast buffet during our stay. No fixed date was noted anywhere. When we turned up for breakfast we were told it was for the previous day and we hadn’t showed up, so bad luck. Once again we had to argue to receive our Breakfast. They only cleaned 2 of the 3 rooms. Removed our dressing gowns from 1 room. They also tried to claim we had stolen a hair dryer.
Room service took 3 visits to bring us all 4 things we ordered.
Fridge’s in rooms were barely cold, and the air condition wasn’t below standard. 
The shower water was either burning hot or freezing cold.
The staff around the pool and in kids club were excellent. The swimming pool was clean and tidy. 
Happy hour at the bar only included a small range of drinks. Drinks service was extremely slow.
We stayed in 5 hotels during our 3 weeks in Thailand.

Having stayed here many times over the past 8 years we feel the hotel now offers poor value for money. Each year the hotel offers less but prices get higher and the hotel totally ignores repeat guests. We still enjoyed our stay which was down to the staff. Our room maid was friendly and kept our room clean and stocked with water and toiletries. No fruit in room now except on first night. Mini bar not used for obvious reasons. Pool and gardens are kept clean and tidy. Great staff at the pool bar. Friendly and good service and have got to know them over the years. This can also be said of Panarat [Noi] and her team who looked after us in the Tavern Sports Bar. 
We return to Pattaya in February but have got a far better deal at a 4 star beach front hotel 10 minutes walk from the Amari. Time will tell if it was the right decision but with savings of just under £1000 we will see.

Came back this year for Christmas and New Year. Booked direct with the hotel. Hotel informed us that there was refurbishment ongoing and that some facilities would be curtailed. However the spa would remain open. Booked transportation with the hotel and pick was excellent and a comfortable ride to the hotel. On arrival we noticed that the Amari garden wing had been demolished and was now a construction site. The sports bar at the front of the hotel had also been demolished. Hotel was surrounded by hoarding. Checked in at the Horizon club. On looking out the window saw the amount of work ongoing on the site. I would class this as major construction NOT refurbishment as they are now laying the founds for a 15 storey extension. The pleasant views we had the last time are gone. We were offered room 1806 but that overlooks the building works and there was noise heard. They immediately offered us another room 2005 which was on the opposite side of the hotel and that was a lot quieter. During the check in procedure my wife was informed that the spa had been closed. We said that it was meant to be open until the end of the year but the girls said that management had decided to close it early. Very disappointed. No information had been sent to us from the hotel regarding this change. My wife likes to use the spa while I go diving. They pointed out that there were other spas and suggested using one at the Dolphin roundabout. Not very relaxing having to dress - walk to the roundabout then back again instead of being able to use the hotel one, use the lift and go back to the room for a rest. The girls in the lounge kept on apologising but as I said to them it wasn't there fault. During our stay a girl in a white uniform came over and asked us about our stay. We said about the major construction rather than refurbishment and also about the spa being closed. She made a note of this but nothing appeared to happen with the information. On the tables in the horizon club they were still advertising the spa and special offers they had on. The last couple of times we stayed at this hotel the manager was called Brendan. He was always on the go chatting to guests asking how they were doing and how the hotel was. This time  no sign of any management. On the plus side room was fine, girls in the Horizon were a credit to Amari and transport to and from airport was good. Just disappointed we paid a premium price to stay here.",Brian G,?.?.-17,3,"Thurso, United Kingdom",Couple,3-Value,5-Rooms,5-Location,5-Cleanliness,5-Service,5-Sleep Quality

Although the ocean view was at an angle but still the view was mesmerizing.
The room was spacious, clean and amenities were plenty..
Amari never fails to impress me.
The hotel staff is and courteous to another level..
And now the highlight.. during our breakfast my wife being a pure vegetarian was struggling to find vegetarian options. Although it was a huge spread but pure vegetarian people are very careful with breads, cakes and spreads.
One of the chefs SRIDHAR KARNATI(I vividly remember the name) surprised us with a masala dosa..he also made masala chai for us. He also made North Indian style masala omlate for me.
We were overjoyed..he also helped us identify the in-house eggless preparation of breads and spreads.

Beside this, the hotel facility in the room is moderate - I mean it suppose to be as it's for 4-5 stars hotel but a bit run down, the swimming pool is good but the breakfast - I may be expect too much.

Then today I went to reception to remind them about my meal that come with the package - the answer I got was oh.. do you want us to book? I was so puzzle, I did told them when I checked in when I want it - again luckily I went to counter to remind them.

This is my second trip to Thailand with family and u generally expect a good service in Thailand across all classes of hotels. But Amari beats all expectations.
Location: Bang off the beach . U can walk to the beach . It has one side of the rooms with ocean view which are awesome. It's about 4km to the walking street which is where you should be when in Pattaya:-)
TIP: they have a system of open mini van which is navy blue colored,. They keep roaming the same routes and u can just hop on and hop off for 10Baht. They are available almost every 5 mins. Only in the late night they may charge a fixed amount if they don't have anyone else in the car. Also u need to press the bell whenever u want to get down.
Rooms : Very spacious rooms must say. Huge bathrooms with a massive bathtub. We were on the 20th flr and had good views. Also.had bunker beds which is fun and convenience for kids. 
Food: Bfast is good. Spread cud be better but it's just fine. 
Service /staff : fantastic service. Genuine smiles on all their faces right from the guards to the reception and house keeping. Really appreciated that attitude.i had a big issue wherein I forgot my handbag with my passport and iPad. I had already checked out and realized when I was at Non g nooch village. I called them and they verified in flat 5 minutes with all items in it. They also arranged to send it to another resort I was staying in around 70km away. They sent their own limo with their own driver for fee of 1000Baht which was something I would have anyway paid for an uberboth ways. Can't thank enough for this service but. Big Thanks ...

The staff was so accommodating, the beds felt like I was sleeping on a cloud, and the international was phenomenal and well worth the money (recommend paying a head or at check in because it’s cheaper). The only complaint I have - which isn’t really a complaint cause I’m sure if I mentioned it it would have been fixed - was the fact that my tub drain didn’t close so I couldn’t use the bath tub but my friends said it was wonderful and I believe them lol

When I checked in, I asked for a late check out on my departure day, and was told that it would cost me a full days rate, as I was leaving so late. But as I had to wait so long for my room, the staff in the end, gave me this free of charge. And that is a great way to start my stay, and get my first impression of hotell and staff! 
I had a ""Junior suite ocean view"" on the 11th floor, if I remember correctly, and there was two things that hit me when I first came in to the ""suite"". How small the so called suite was, and the incredible view from the the whole side of the wall, that was just big windows. Very nice! 
The room otherwise, or the so called suite, was nothing special. And for the price there are better options with bigger rooms available.  
When I was there, major construction was ongoing. Because of this the breakfast was served at the separate building that is the location of Mantra restaurant, and getting to the pool was a bit of a detour. nothing major. 
The breakfast is good, with more then enough options. Especially liked that they had two options for the bacon tray, crisp and soggy. Why you would eat soggy bacon, is beyond me, but good that they have the option. 
Staff was great, cleanness in room very good, and in hotel good as well. 
One thing to keep in mind, and that is not on the website, is that if you plan to bring ""overnight"" guests to room, the hotel charge you 1000Thb/30.69$/26.98€ per night extra.

For us the room we had and the excellent staff more then made up for the noise. Check in was very professional cool towels and chilled drinks were provided while the pleasent staff sorted everything out. Alas we were not told till we got to the room that somebody had gone through the mains power and taken out the air conditioning.
 Did not worry at the time as we went for a wander round Pattaya. On getting back however there was still no AC and the hotel and our room was very hot. On going back to reception to see what was going on the excellent staff arranged for the bar to be opened early and gave us happy hour drinks. I appreciate things out of anybodies control go wrong but the mark of a good hotel is how they handle it. This was handled in our view very well. We went for A Grand Deluxe Ocean View room which was well worth the extra. Furnished to a very high standard and the view was nothing short of spectacular.  But what really makes this hotel a cut above any other we've stayed in is the staff. Everybody and I mean everybody was so polite and went out of there way to be helpful. Nothing at all was too much trouble.
We had the buffet breakfast which had English, Indian, Chinese, and Thai style food plus more cake and fruit then you would see in a life time. Again it was the staff.... fetching coffee making sure everything was OK which made it a pleasant start to the day. Spent the day by the pool and again back to the staff, friedly efficient making sure we were comfortable. By the second day they were starting to recognise us and more friendly warm greetings. Managers and the chef walking round talking to the guests asking how they could improve and making sure everything was OK.
On our last night we had a meal in the Mantra restaurant which had a mixture of styles we went Contemporary Thai which was again excellent. They even had a Thai craft beer.

The whole place exudes quality,class and service. 
I had booked an exec room so it's straight upto the 19th floor to check in. I was told the room wasn't ready even though it was 2pm but the words ""you've been upgraded "" made the short wait worthwhile. 
We were escorted to the rooms and I have to say I was very impressed. Just as I was wondering where the bed was I spotted the stairs in the room!! It was a duplex! The whole room is fantastic. A desk, a kitchenette,a lounge,flat screen tv,s , a downstairs toilet and fantastic views across Pattaya and the Gulf. The list goes on. 
Then you go upstairs. Massive bed,another tv , 2 sinks,and separate toilet and shower rooms. 
There is a room safe in the wardrobe and free water on both levels. The mini bars are well stocked.the bed was comfortable. 
The pool are is marvellous and very relaxing. The noodle soup cart makes great soup and there are numerous waiters around for drinks etc. Plenty towels are available. 
The swim up bar is fab. Try a Capirinha for 250 baht. Very nice indeed. There are also 2-4-1 happy hours too. 
If your in an exec room you get breakfast and evening happy hour. 
Top tip is use the Essence restaurant on the 3rd floor if you make brekky. It has more choice than the exec lounge on the 19th although the 19th is quieter. You can only use the 19th floor lounge if in the exec accommodation. 
Evening happy hour on the 19th floor is fab. 17:30-19:30 there is a wide selection of canapés and snacks and deserts plus lovely drinks served by the staff. The G and T I can recommend. 
There is a dress code which I was glad to see being enforced and adds to the refined ambience I expected from this type of hotel. No Singha vest please. Lol. 
The wifi is faultless wherever you are.

The staff from arrival to departure were amazing everything was very peaceful and I enjoyed the welcome towel and drink after the 13hr flight.

The breakfast is typically Asian international and of good quality.

The pools and sun areas are well kept and the main pool very warm and long. I relaxed a lot while I was here even though I was working.

I loved Thailand and Amari so much that I am visiting Amari Koh Samui in September with my wife for a 2 week holiday.

This was my third visit and once again the hotel did not disappoint me. The staff are exceptional, always smiling, always acknowledging you and happy to talk to you. On our first day, One particular staff member from the reception desk, Leylar, approached us in front of the counter and welcomed us back , used our first names and shook our hands. Wow, I just found this so welcoming. It felt like family. I would also like to mention Pear and Ko (Aquatic Manager) for their hospitality and genuine care in your needs and wanting to know you. Pear also remembered us from last year which was terrific. Honestly, the entire staff group are warm , friendly and always greet you with a smile. When I left, three security staff met me at the. Taxi to say goodbye with a salute, handshake & hug. I miss these guys so much. The hotel is beautifully maintained, rooms are consistently cleaned professionally, the swimming area and it’s bar service caters for all age groups and us great for families as the children will enjoy the water activities. The buffet dining experience on level 3 will cater for all taste buds. The Amari Pattaya is surely my favourite hotel experience anywhere in the world and I will be back.

Our room was a Deluxe room with pool view. The first thing I should mention is that there was quite an amount of construction under way at the time of our visit. The hotel did their best to ameliorate any negative impact this might have on guests. I was not particularly bothered by this, however depending on the purpose of your visit you might feel differently.

The lobby is impressive with very high ceilings and is of a high standard throughout both in terms of workmanship and materials used. The rooms are spacious, stylish and well appointed. Our pool view room also had a view of the beach which was nice. 

The staff were very friendly and professional. The breakfast was excellent.

I had a couple of swims at the pool. It did not have a deep end.

Check-in and check-out was efficient. There was one female member of staff who was very knowledgeable and was able to provide us with useful information about the next hotel we were travelling to in Bangkok. One final point, I paid a deposit on check-in with my credit card to cover incidentals.This was not fully used and so I was due a refund to my credit card at the end of our stay. It has been more than 40 days since we checked out and the refund has still not been processed.

Especially high quality on the bed promises good sleeping.  However I would like you to improve the quality for Japanese food on the breakfast.  It was happy to find Japanese food but the 'dashi' which is one of the most important to feel good or not good is not good.  Not good means that every Japanese tourist easily knows the food is not cooked or checked by Japanese chef.

On arrival at the hotel I was pleasantly surprised with how friendly the staff  were and how the bell boys were taking our stuff to our room. 

We were given a room for supposedly 3 people originally as we were travelling as a family of 3 but unfortunately with me being 6ft1 the bed was simply not long enough and there was no way I could of survived 17 nights in a tiny portable camp bed. Staff were great and moved us to a family room where I had to adhere with bunkbeds but it was fine! Lovely room. Private bathroom. Looked on to the mercure and the holiday inn hotels over the road.
We had an issue with aircon in this room however and were told we needed to move, wended up in a duplex room in the 20th floor which was stunning. Views looking over the pool and the beach. Fantastic. Maid cleaned the rooms everyday and replenished  all items we'd used like the complimentary water etc. always spotless! 

Pool was great. However, the hotel don't seem to grasp that people were going in fully clothed and that's not hygenic! Lots of sunbeds but need it get up super early to get the best ones! Pool food isn't the cheapest but it's spot on for quality. Really nice. Drinks are expensive too but still nice. 

The Horizon Lounge is fabulous. Food is great and staff are brill. Deffo worth spending your money on this if you haven't already.. Breakfast here was delicious.
